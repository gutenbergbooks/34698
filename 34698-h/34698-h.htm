  <p>Most of the Essays comprised in the present volume have been written
  during the last six or seven years, without premeditated purpose or
  intentional connection, in reply to attacks upon doctrines which I hold
  to be well founded; or in refutation of allegations respecting matters
  lying within the province of natural knowledge, which I believe to be
  erroneous; and they bear the mark of their origin in the controversial
  tone which pervades them.</p>

  <p>Of polemical writing, as of other kinds of warfare, I think it may be
  said, that it is often useful, sometimes necessary, and always more or
  less of an evil. It is useful, when it attracts attention to topics which
  might otherwise be neglected; and when, as does sometimes happen, those
  who come to see a contest remain to think. It is necessary, when the
  interests of truth and of justice are at stake. It is an evil, in so far
  as controversy always tends to degenerate into quarrelling, to swerve
  from the great issue of what is right and what is wrong to the very small
  question <!-- Page 2 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page2"></a>{2}</span>of who is right and who is wrong. I venture to
  hope that the useful and the necessary were more conspicuous than the
  evil attributes of literary militancy, when these papers were first
  published; but I have had some hesitation about reprinting them. If I may
  judge by my own taste, few literary dishes are less appetising than cold
  controversy; moreover, there is an air of unfairness about the
  presentation of only one side of a discussion, and a flavour of
  unkindness in the reproduction of "winged words," which, however
  appropriate at the time of their utterance, would find a still more
  appropriate place in oblivion. Yet, since I could hardly ask those who
  have honoured me by their polemical attentions to confer lustre on this
  collection, by permitting me to present their lucubrations along with my
  own; and since it would be a manifest wrong to them to deprive their, by
  no means rare, vivacities of language of such justification as they may
  derive from similar freedoms on my part; I came to the conclusion that my
  best course was to leave the essays just as they were written;<a
  name="NtA1" href="#Nt1"><sup>[1]</sup></a> assuring my honourable
  adversaries that any heat of which signs may remain was generated, in
  accordance with the law of the conservation of energy, by the force of
  their own blows, and has long since been dissipated into space.</p>

  <p>But, however the polemical concomitants of these discussions may be
  regarded&mdash;or better, <!-- Page 3 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page3"></a>{3}</span>disregarded&mdash;there is no doubt either
  about the importance of the topics of which they treat, or as to the
  public interest in the "Controverted Questions" with which they deal. Or
  rather, the Controverted Question; for disconnected as these pieces may,
  perhaps, appear to be, they are, in fact, concerned only with different
  aspects of a single problem, with which thinking men have been occupied,
  ever since they began seriously to consider the wonderful frame of things
  in which their lives are set, and to seek for trustworthy guidance among
  its intricacies.</p>

  <p>Experience speedily taught them that the shifting scenes of the
  world's stage have a permanent background; that there is order amidst the
  seeming confusion, and that many events take place according to
  unchanging rules. To this region of familiar steadiness and customary
  regularity they gave the name of Nature. But, at the same time, their
  infantile and untutored reason, little more, as yet, than the playfellow
  of the imagination, led them to believe that this tangible, commonplace,
  orderly world of Nature was surrounded and interpenetrated by another
  intangible and mysterious world, no more bound by fixed rules than, as
  they fancied, were the thoughts and passions which coursed through their
  minds and seemed to exercise an intermittent and capricious rule over
  their bodies. They attributed to the entities, with which they peopled
  this dim and dreadful region, an unlimited amount of that power of
  modifying the course of events of which they themselves possessed a small
  share, and thus <!-- Page 4 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page4"></a>{4}</span>came to regard them as not merely beyond, but
  above, Nature.</p>

  <p>Hence arose the conception of a "Supernature" antithetic to
  "Nature"&mdash;the primitive dualism of a natural world "fixed in fate"
  and a supernatural, left to the free play of volition&mdash;which has
  pervaded all later speculation and, for thousands of years, has exercised
  a profound influence on practice. For it is obvious that, on this theory
  of the Universe, the successful conduct of life must demand careful
  attention to both worlds; and, if either is to be neglected, it may be
  safer that it should be Nature. In any given contingency, it must
  doubtless be desirable to know what may be expected to happen in the
  ordinary course of things; but it must be quite as necessary to have some
  inkling of the line likely to be taken by supernatural agencies able, and
  possibly willing, to suspend or reverse that course. Indeed, logically
  developed, the dualistic theory must needs end in almost exclusive
  attention to Supernature, and in trust that its over-ruling strength will
  be exerted in favour of those who stand well with its denizens. On the
  other hand, the lessons of the great schoolmaster, experience, have
  hardly seemed to accord with this conclusion. They have taught, with
  considerable emphasis, that it does not answer to neglect Nature; and
  that, on the whole, the more attention paid to her dictates the better
  men fare.</p>

  <p>Thus the theoretical antithesis brought about a practical antagonism.
  From the earliest times of which we have any knowledge, Naturalism and
  <!-- Page 5 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page5"></a>{5}</span>Supernaturalism have consciously, or
  unconsciously, competed and struggled with one another; and the varying
  fortunes of the contest are written in the records of the course of
  civilisation, from those of Egypt and Babylonia, six thousand years ago,
  down to those of our own time and people.</p>

  <p>These records inform us that, so far as men have paid attention to
  Nature, they have been rewarded for their pains. They have developed the
  Arts which have furnished the conditions of civilised existence; and the
  Sciences, which have been a progressive revelation of reality and have
  afforded the best discipline of the mind in the methods of discovering
  truth. They have accumulated a vast body of universally accepted
  knowledge; and the conceptions of man and of society, of morals and of
  law, based upon that knowledge, are every day more and more, either
  openly or tacitly, acknowledged to be the foundations of right
  action.</p>

  <p>History also tells us that the field of the supernatural has rewarded
  its cultivators with a harvest, perhaps not less luxuriant, but of a
  different character. It has produced an almost infinite diversity of
  Religions. These, if we set aside the ethical concomitants upon which
  natural knowledge also has a claim, are composed of information about
  Supernature; they tell us of the attributes of supernatural beings, of
  their relations with Nature, and of the operations by which their
  interference with the ordinary course of events can be secured or
  averted. It does not appear, however, that supernaturalists have attained
  <!-- Page 6 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page6"></a>{6}</span>to any
  agreement about these matters, or that history indicates a widening of
  the influence of supernaturalism on practice, with the onward flow of
  time. On the contrary, the various religions are, to a great extent,
  mutually exclusive; and their adherents delight in charging each other,
  not merely with error, but with criminality, deserving <span
  class="correction" title="Original reads 'and'.">an</span> ensuing
  punishment of infinite severity. In singular contrast with natural
  knowledge, again, the acquaintance of mankind with the supernatural
  appears the more extensive and the more exact, and the influence of
  supernatural doctrines upon conduct the greater, the further back we go
  in time and the lower the stage of civilisation submitted to
  investigation. Historically, indeed, there would seem to be an inverse
  relation between supernatural and natural knowledge. As the latter has
  widened, gained in precision and in trustworthiness, so has the former
  shrunk, grown vague and questionable; as the one has more and more filled
  the sphere of action, so has the other retreated into the region of
  meditation, or vanished behind the screen of mere verbal recognition.</p>

  <p>Whether this difference of the fortunes of Naturalism and of
  Supernaturalism is an indication of the progress, or of the regress, of
  humanity; of a fall from, or an advance towards, the higher life; is a
  matter of opinion. The point to which I wish to direct attention is that
  the difference exists and is making itself felt. Men are growing to be
  seriously alive to the fact that the historical evolution of humanity,
  which is generally, and I venture to <!-- Page 7 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page7"></a>{7}</span>think not unreasonably,
  regarded as progress, has been, and is being, accompanied by a
  co-ordinate elimination of the supernatural from its originally large
  occupation of men's thoughts. The question&mdash;How far is this process
  to go?&mdash;is, in my apprehension, the Controverted Question of our
  time.</p>

  <p>&nbsp;</p>

  <p>Controversy on this matter&mdash;prolonged, bitter, and fought out
  with the weapons of the flesh, as well as with those of the
  spirit&mdash;is no new thing to Englishmen. We have been more or less
  occupied with it these five hundred years. And, during that time, we have
  made attempts to establish a <i>modus vivendi</i> between the
  antagonists, some of which have had a world-wide influence; though,
  unfortunately, none have proved universally and permanently
  satisfactory.</p>

  <p>In the fourteenth century, the controverted question among us was,
  whether certain portions of the Supernaturalism of mediæval Christianity
  were well-founded. John Wicliff proposed a solution of the problem which,
  in the course of the following two hundred years, acquired wide
  popularity and vast historical importance: Lollards, Hussites, Lutherans,
  Calvinists, Zwinglians, Socinians, and Anabaptists, whatever their
  disagreements, concurred in the proposal to reduce the Supernaturalism of
  Christianity within the limits sanctioned by the Scriptures. None of the
  chiefs of Protestantism called in question either the supernatural origin
  and infallible authority of the Bible, or the exactitude of the account
  of the <!-- Page 8 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page8"></a>{8}</span>supernatural world given in its pages. In
  fact, they could not afford to entertain any doubt about these points,
  since the infallible Bible was the fulcrum of the lever with which they
  were endeavouring to upset the Chair of St. Peter. The "freedom of
  private judgment" which they proclaimed, meant no more, in practice, than
  permission to themselves to make free with the public judgment of the
  Roman Church, in respect of the canon and of the meaning to be attached
  to the words of the canonical books. Private judgment&mdash;that is to
  say, reason&mdash;was (theoretically, at any rate) at liberty to decide
  what books were and what were not to take the rank of "Scripture"; and to
  determine the sense of any passage in such books. But this sense, once
  ascertained to the mind of the sectary, was to be taken for pure
  truth&mdash;for the very word of God. The controversial efficiency of the
  principle of biblical infallibility lay in the fact that the conservative
  adversaries of the Reformers were not in a position to contravene it
  without entangling themselves in serious difficulties; while, since both
  Papists and Protestants agreed in taking efficient measures to stop the
  mouths of any more radical critics, these did not count.</p>

  <p>The impotence of their adversaries, however, did not remove the
  inherent weakness of the position of the Protestants. The dogma of the
  infallibility of the Bible is no more self-evident than is that of the
  infallibility of the Pope. If the former is held by "faith," then the
  latter may be. If the latter is <!-- Page 9 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page9"></a>{9}</span>to be accepted, or rejected, by private
  judgment, why not the former? Even if the Bible could be proved anywhere
  to assert its own infallibility, the value of that self-assertion to
  those who dispute the point is not obvious. On the other hand, if the
  infallibility of the Bible was rested on that of a "primitive Church,"
  the admission that the "Church" was formerly infallible was awkward in
  the extreme for those who denied its present infallibility. Moreover, no
  sooner was the Protestant principle applied to practice, than it became
  evident that even an infallible text, when manipulated by private
  judgment, will impartially countenance contradictory deductions; and
  furnish forth creeds and confessions as diverse as the quality and the
  information of the intellects which exercise, and the prejudices and
  passions which sway, such judgments. Every sect, confident in the
  derivative infallibility of its wire-drawing of infallible materials, was
  ready to supply its contingent of martyrs; and to enable history, once
  more, to illustrate the truth, that steadfastness under persecution says
  much for the sincerity and still more for the tenacity, of the believer,
  but very little for the objective truth of that which he believes. No
  martyrs have sealed their faith with their blood more steadfastly than
  the Anabaptists.</p>

  <p>Last, but not least, the Protestant principle contained within itself
  the germs of the destruction of the finality, which the Lutheran,
  Calvinistic, and other Protestant Churches fondly imagined they had
  reached. Since their creeds were professedly based <!-- Page 10 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page10"></a>{10}</span>on the canonical
  Scriptures, it followed that, in the long run, whoso settled the canon
  defined the creed. If the private judgment of Luther might legitimately
  conclude that the epistle of James was contemptible, while the epistles
  of Paul contained the very essence of Christianity, it must be
  permissible for some other private judgment, on as good or as bad
  grounds, to reverse these conclusions; the critical process which
  excluded the Apocrypha could not be barred, at any rate by people who
  rejected the authority of the Church, from extending its operations to
  Daniel, the Canticles, and Ecclesiastes; nor, having got so far, was it
  easy to allege any good ground for staying the further progress of
  criticism. In fact, the logical development of Protestantism could not
  fail to lay the authority of the Scriptures at the feet of Reason; and,
  in the hands of latitudinarian and rationalistic theologians, the
  despotism of the Bible was rapidly converted into an extremely limited
  monarchy. Treated with as much respect as ever, the sphere of its
  practical authority was minimised; and its decrees were valid only so far
  as they were countersigned by common sense, the responsible minister.</p>

  <p>The champions of Protestantism are much given to glorify the
  Reformation of the sixteenth century as the emancipation of Reason; but
  it may be doubted if their contention has any solid ground; while there
  is a good deal of evidence to show, that aspirations after intellectual
  freedom had nothing whatever to do with the movement. Dante, who struck
  the Papacy <!-- Page 11 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page11"></a>{11}</span>as hard blows as Wicliff; Wicliff himself
  and Luther himself, when they began their work; were far enough from any
  intention of meddling with even the most irrational of the dogmas of
  mediæval Supernaturalism. From Wicliff to Socinus, or even to Münzer,
  Rothmann, and John of Leyden, I fail to find a trace of any desire to set
  reason free. The most that can be discovered is a proposal to change
  masters. From being the slave of the Papacy the intellect was to become
  the serf of the Bible; or, to speak more accurately, of somebody's
  interpretation of the Bible, which, rapidly shifting its attitude from
  the humility of a private judgment to the arrogant Cæsaro-papistry of a
  state-enforced creed, had no more hesitation about forcibly extinguishing
  opponent private judgments and judges, than had the old-fashioned
  Pontiff-papistry.</p>

  <p>It was the iniquities, and not the irrationalities, of the Papal
  system that lay at the bottom of the revolt of the laity; which was,
  essentially, an attempt to shake off the intolerable burden of certain
  practical deductions from a Supernaturalism in which everybody, in
  principle, acquiesced. What was the gain to intellectual freedom of
  abolishing transubstantiation, image worship, indulgences, ecclesiastical
  infallibility; if consubstantiation, real-unreal presence mystifications,
  the bibliolatry, the "inner-light" pretensions, and the demonology, which
  are fruits of the same supernaturalistic tree, remained in enjoyment of
  the spiritual and temporal support of a new infallibility? One does not
  free a <!-- Page 12 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page12"></a>{12}</span>prisoner by merely scraping away the rust
  from his shackles.</p>

  <p>It will be asked, perhaps, was not the Reformation one of the products
  of that great outbreak of many-sided free mental activity included under
  the general head of the Renascence? Melanchthon, Ulrich von Hutten, Beza,
  were they not all humanists? Was not the arch-humanist, Erasmus,
  fautor-in-chief of the Reformation, until he got frightened and basely
  deserted it?</p>

  <p>From the language of Protestant historians, it would seem that they
  often forget that Reformation and Protestantism are by no means
  convertible terms. There were plenty of sincere and indeed zealous
  reformers, before, during, and after the birth and growth of
  Protestantism, who would have nothing to do with it. Assuredly, the
  rejuvenescence of science and of art; the widening of the field of Nature
  by geographical and astronomical discovery; the revelation of the noble
  ideals of antique literature by the revival of classical learning; the
  stir of thought, throughout all classes of society, by the printers'
  work, loosened traditional bonds and weakened the hold of mediæval
  Supernaturalism. In the interests of liberal culture and of national
  welfare, the humanists were eager to lend a hand to anything which tended
  to the discomfiture of their sworn enemies, the monks, and they willingly
  supported every movement in the direction of weakening ecclesiastical
  interference with civil life. But the bond of a common enemy was the only
  real tie between the humanist <!-- Page 13 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page13"></a>{13}</span>and the protestant; their alliance was bound
  to be of short duration, and, sooner or later, to be replaced by
  internecine warfare. The goal of the humanists, whether they were aware
  of it or not, was the attainment of the complete intellectual freedom of
  the antique philosopher, than which nothing could be more abhorrent to a
  Luther, a Calvin, a Beza, or a Zwingli.</p>

  <p>The key to the comprehension of the conduct of Erasmus, seems to me to
  lie in the clear apprehension of this fact. That he was a man of many
  weaknesses may be true; in fact, he was quite aware of them and professed
  himself no hero. But he never deserted that reformatory movement which he
  originally contemplated; and it was impossible he should have deserted
  the specifically Protestant reformation in which he never took part. He
  was essentially a theological whig, to whom radicalism was as hateful as
  it is to all whigs; or, to borrow a still more appropriate comparison
  from modern times, a broad churchman who refused to enlist with either
  the High Church or the Low Church zealots, and paid the penalty of being
  called coward, time-server and traitor, by both. Yet really there is a
  good deal in his pathetic remonstrance that he does not see why he is
  bound to become a martyr for that in which he does not believe; and a
  fair consideration of the circumstances and the consequences of the
  Protestant reformation seems to me to go a long way towards justifying
  the course he adopted.</p>

  <p>Few men had better means of being acquainted <!-- Page 14 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page14"></a>{14}</span>with the condition of
  Europe; none could be more competent to gauge the intellectual
  shallowness and self-contradiction of the protestant criticism of
  catholic doctrine; and to estimate, at its proper value, the fond
  imagination that the waters let out by the Renascence would come to rest
  amidst the blind alleys of the new ecclesiasticism. The bastard, whilom
  poor student and monk, become the familiar of bishops and princes, at
  home in all grades of society, could not fail to be aware of the gravity
  of the social position, of the dangers imminent from the profligacy and
  indifference of the ruling classes, no less than from the anarchical
  tendencies of the people who groaned under their oppression. The wanderer
  who had lived in Germany, in France, in England, in Italy, and who
  counted many of the best and most influential men in each country among
  his friends, was not likely to estimate wrongly the enormous forces which
  were still at the command of the Papacy. Bad as the churchmen might be,
  the statesmen were worse; and a person of far more sanguine temperament
  than Erasmus might have seen no hope for the future, except in gradually
  freeing the ubiquitous organisation of the Church from the corruptions
  which alone, as he imagined, prevented it from being as beneficent as it
  was powerful. The broad tolerance of the scholar and man of the world
  might well be revolted by the ruffianism, however genial, of one great
  light of Protestantism, and the narrow fanaticism, however learned and
  logical, of others; and to a cautious thinker, by whom, whatever his
  shortcomings, the <!-- Page 15 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page15"></a>{15}</span>ethical ideal of the Christian evangel was
  sincerely prized, it really was a fair question, whether it was worth
  while to bring about a political and social deluge, the end of which no
  mortal could foresee, for the purpose of setting up Lutheran, Zwinglian,
  and other Peterkins, in the place of the actual claimant to the reversion
  of the spiritual wealth of the Galilean fisherman.</p>

  <p>Let us suppose that, at the beginning of the Lutheran and Zwinglian
  movement, a vision of its immediate consequences had been granted to
  Erasmus; imagine that to the spectre of the fierce outbreak of Anabaptist
  communism, which opened the apocalypse, had succeeded, in shadowy
  procession, the reign of terror and of spoliation in England, with the
  judicial murders of his friends, More and Fisher; the bitter tyranny of
  evangelistic clericalism in Geneva and in Scotland; the long agony of
  religious wars, persecutions, and massacres, which devastated France and
  reduced Germany almost to savagery; finishing with the spectacle of
  Lutheranism in its native country sunk into mere dead Erastian formalism,
  before it was a century old; while Jesuitry triumphed over Protestantism
  in three-fourths of Europe, bringing in its train a recrudescence of all
  the corruptions Erasmus and his friends sought to abolish; might not he
  have quite honestly thought this a somewhat too heavy price to pay for
  Protestantism; more especially, since no one was in a better position
  than himself to know how little the dogmatic foundation of the new
  confessions was able to bear the light <!-- Page 16 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page16"></a>{16}</span>which the inevitable
  progress of humanistic criticism would throw upon them? As the wiser of
  his contemporaries saw, Erasmus was, at heart, neither Protestant nor
  Papist, but an "Independent Christian"; and, as the wiser of his modern
  biographers have discerned, he was the precursor, not of sixteenth
  century reform, but of eighteenth century "enlightenment"; a sort of
  broad-church Voltaire, who held by his "Independent Christianity" as
  stoutly as Voltaire by his Deism.</p>

  <p>In fact, the stream of the Renascence, which bore Erasmus along, left
  Protestantism stranded amidst the mudbanks of its articles and creeds:
  while its true course became visible to all men, two centuries later. By
  this time, those in whom the movement of the Renascence was incarnate
  became aware what spirit they were of; and they attacked Supernaturalism
  in its Biblical stronghold, defended by Protestants and Romanists with
  equal zeal. In the eyes of the "Patriarch," Ultramontanism, Jansenism,
  and Calvinism were merely three persons of the one "Infâme" which it was
  the object of his life to crush. If he hated one more than another, it
  was probably the last; while D'Holbach, and the extreme left of the
  free-thinking host, were disposed to show no more mercy to Deism and
  Pantheism.</p>

  <p>The sceptical insurrection of the eighteenth century made a terrific
  noise and frightened not a few worthy people out of their wits; but cool
  judges might have foreseen, at the outset, that the efforts of the later
  rebels were no more likely <!-- Page 17 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page17"></a>{17}</span>than those of the earlier, to furnish
  permanent resting-places for the spirit of scientific inquiry. However
  worthy of admiration may be the acuteness, the common-sense, the wit, the
  broad humanity, which abound in the writings of the best of the
  free-thinkers; there is rarely much to be said for their work as an
  example of the adequate treatment of a grave and difficult investigation.
  I do not think any impartial judge will assert that, from this point of
  view, they are much better than their adversaries. It must be admitted
  that they share to the full the fatal weakness of <i>à priori</i>
  philosophising, no less than the moral frivolity common to their age;
  while a singular want of appreciation of history, as the record of the
  moral and social evolution of the human race, permitted them to resort to
  preposterous theories of imposture, in order to account for the religious
  phenomena which are natural products of that evolution.</p>

  <p>For the most part, the Romanist and Protestant adversaries of the
  free-thinkers met them with arguments no better than their own; and with
  vituperation, so far inferior that it lacked the wit. But one great
  Christian apologist fairly captured the guns of the free-thinking array,
  and turned their batteries upon themselves. Speculative "infidelity" of
  the eighteenth century type was mortally wounded by the <i>Analogy</i>;
  while the progress of the historical and psychological sciences brought
  to light the important part played by the mythop&oelig;ic faculty; and,
  by demonstrating the extreme readiness of men <!-- Page 18 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page18"></a>{18}</span>to impose upon
  themselves, rendered the calling in of sacerdotal co-operation, in most
  cases, a superfluity.</p>

  <p>Again, as in the fourteenth and the sixteenth centuries, social and
  political influences came into play. The free-thinking
  <i>philosophes</i>, who objected to Rousseau's sentimental religiosity
  almost as much as they did to <i>L'Infâme</i>, were credited with the
  responsibility for all the evil deeds of Rousseau's Jacobin disciples,
  with about as much justification as Wicliff was held responsible for the
  Peasants' revolt, or Luther for the <i>Bauern-krieg</i>. In England,
  though our <i>ancien régime</i> was not altogether lovely, the social
  edifice was never in such a bad way as in France; it was still capable of
  being repaired; and our forefathers, very wisely, preferred to wait until
  that operation could be safely performed, rather than pull it all down
  about their ears, in order to build a philosophically planned house on
  brand-new speculative foundations. Under these circumstances, it is not
  wonderful that, in this country, practical men preferred the gospel of
  Wesley and Whitfield to that of Jean Jacques; while enough of the old
  leaven of Puritanism remained to ensure the favour and support of a large
  number of religious men to a revival of evangelical supernaturalism.
  Thus, by degrees, the free-thinking, or the indifference, prevalent among
  us in the first half of the eighteenth century, was replaced by a strong
  supernaturalistic reaction, which submerged the work of the
  free-thinkers; and even seemed, for a time, to have arrested the
  naturalistic movement of <!-- Page 19 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page19"></a>{19}</span>which that work was an imperfect indication.
  Yet, like Lollardry, four centuries earlier, free-thought merely took to
  running underground, safe, sooner or later, to return to the surface.</p>

  <p>&nbsp;</p>

  <p>My memory, unfortunately, carries me back to the fourth decade of the
  nineteenth century, when the evangelical flood had a little abated and
  the tops of certain mountains were soon to appear, chiefly in the
  neighbourhood of Oxford; but when, nevertheless, bibliolatry was rampant;
  when church and chapel alike proclaimed, as the oracles of God, the crude
  assumptions of the worst informed and, in natural sequence, the most
  presumptuously bigoted, of all theological schools.</p>

  <p>In accordance with promises made on my behalf, but certainly without
  my authorisation, I was very early taken to hear "sermons in the vulgar
  tongue." And vulgar enough often was the tongue in which some preacher,
  ignorant alike of literature, of history, of science, and even of
  theology, outside that patronised by his own narrow school, poured forth,
  from the safe entrenchment of the pulpit, invectives against those who
  deviated from his notion of orthodoxy. From dark allusions to "sceptics"
  and "infidels," I became aware of the existence of people who trusted in
  carnal reason; who audaciously doubted that the world was made in six
  natural days, or that the deluge was universal; perhaps even went so far
  as to question the literal accuracy of the story of Eve's temptation, or
  of <!-- Page 20 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page20"></a>{20}</span>Balaam's ass; and, from the horror of the
  tones in which they were mentioned, I should have been justified in
  drawing the conclusion that these rash men belonged to the criminal
  classes. At the same time, those who were more directly responsible for
  providing me with the knowledge essential to the right guidance of life
  (and who sincerely desired to do so), imagined they were discharging that
  most sacred duty by impressing upon my childish mind the necessity, on
  pain of reprobation in this world and damnation in the next, of
  accepting, in the strict and literal sense, every statement contained in
  the protestant Bible. I was told to believe, and I did believe, that
  doubt about any of them was a sin, not less reprehensible than a moral
  delict. I suppose that, out of a thousand of my contemporaries, nine
  hundred, at least, had their minds systematically warped and poisoned, in
  the name of the God of truth, by like discipline. I am sure that, even a
  score of years later, those who ventured to question the exact historical
  accuracy of any part of the Old Testament and <i>à fortiori</i> of the
  Gospels, had to expect a pitiless shower of verbal missiles, to say
  nothing of the other disagreeable consequences which visit those who, in
  any way, run counter to that chaos of prejudices called public
  opinion.</p>

  <p>My recollections of this time have recently been revived by the
  perusal of a remarkable document,<a name="NtA2"
  href="#Nt2"><sup>[2]</sup></a> <!-- Page 21 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page21"></a>{21}</span>signed by as many as thirty-eight out of the
  twenty odd thousand clergymen of the Established Church. It does not
  appear that the signataries are officially accredited spokesmen of the
  ecclesiastical corporation to which they belong; but I feel bound to take
  their word for it, that they are "stewards of the Lord, who have received
  the Holy Ghost," and, therefore, to accept this memorial as evidence
  that, though the Evangelicism of my early days may be deposed from its
  place of power, though so many of the colleagues of the thirty-eight even
  repudiate the title of Protestants, yet the green bay tree of bibliolatry
  flourishes as it did sixty years ago. And, as in those good old times,
  whoso refuses to offer incense to the idol is held to be guilty of "a
  dishonour to God," imperilling his salvation.</p>

  <p>It is to the credit of the perspicacity of the memorialists that they
  discern the real nature of the Controverted Question of the age. They are
  awake to the unquestionable fact that, if Scripture has been discovered
  "not to be worthy of unquestioning belief," faith "in the supernatural
  itself" is, so far, undermined. And I may congratulate myself upon such
  weighty confirmation of an opinion in which I have had the fortune to
  anticipate them. But whether it is more to the credit of the courage,
  than to the intelligence, of the thirty-eight that they should go on to
  proclaim that the canonical scriptures of the Old and New Testaments
  "declare incontrovertibly the actual historical truth in all records,
  both of past events and of the delivery of predictions <!-- Page 22
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page22"></a>{22}</span>to be thereafter
  fulfilled," must be left to the coming generation to decide.</p>

  <p>The interest which attaches to this singular document will, I think,
  be based by most thinking men, not upon what it is, but upon that of
  which it is a sign. It is an open secret, that the memorial is put forth
  as a counterblast to a manifestation of opinion of a contrary character,
  on the part of certain members of the same ecclesiastical body, who
  therefore have, as I suppose, an equal right to declare themselves
  "stewards of the Lord and recipients of the Holy Ghost." In fact, the
  stream of tendency towards Naturalism, the course of which I have briefly
  traced, has, of late years, flowed so strongly, that even the Churches
  have begun, I dare not say to drift, but, at any rate, to swing at their
  moorings. Within the pale of the Anglican establishment, I venture to
  doubt, whether, at this moment, there are as many thorough-going
  defenders of "plenary inspiration" as there were timid questioners of
  that doctrine, half a century ago. Commentaries, sanctioned by the
  highest authority, give up the "actual historical truth" of the
  cosmogonical and diluvial narratives. University professors of deservedly
  high repute accept the critical decision that the Hexateuch is a
  compilation, in which the share of Moses, either as author or as editor,
  is not quite so clearly demonstrable as it might be; highly placed
  Divines tell us that the pre-Abrahamic Scripture narratives may be
  ignored; that the book of Daniel may be regarded as a patriotic romance
  of <!-- Page 23 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page23"></a>{23}</span>the second century <span
  class="scac">B.C.</span>; that the words of the writer of the fourth
  Gospel are not always to be distinguished from those which he puts into
  the mouth of Jesus. Conservative, but conscientious, revisers decide that
  whole passages, some of dogmatic and some of ethical importance, are
  interpolations. An uneasy sense of the weakness of the dogma of Biblical
  infallibility seems to be at the bottom of a prevailing tendency once
  more to substitute the authority of the "Church" for that of the Bible.
  In my old age, it has happened to me to be taken to task for regarding
  Christianity as a "religion of a book" as gravely as, in my youth, I
  should have been reprehended for doubting that proposition. It is a no
  less interesting symptom that the State Church seems more and more
  anxious to repudiate all complicity with the principles of the Protestant
  Reformation and to call itself "Anglo-Catholic." Inspiration, deprived of
  its old intelligible sense, is watered down into a mystification. The
  Scriptures are, indeed, inspired; but they contain a wholly undefined and
  indefinable "human element"; and this unfortunate intruder is converted
  into a sort of biblical whipping boy. Whatsoever scientific
  investigation, historical or physical, proves to be erroneous, the "human
  element" bears the blame; while the divine inspiration of such
  statements, as by their nature are out of reach of proof or disproof, is
  still asserted with all the vigour inspired by conscious safety from
  attack. Though the proposal to treat the Bible "like any other book"
  which caused so much <!-- Page 24 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page24"></a>{24}</span>scandal, forty years ago, may not yet be
  generally accepted, and though Bishop Colenso's criticisms may still lie,
  formally, under ecclesiastical ban, yet the Church has not wholly turned
  a deaf ear to the voice of the scientific tempter; and many a coy divine,
  while "crying I will ne'er consent," has consented to the proposals of
  that scientific criticism which the memorialists renounce and
  denounce.</p>

  <p>A humble layman, to whom it would seem the height of presumption to
  assume even the unconsidered dignity of a "steward of science," may well
  find this conflict of apparently equal ecclesiastical authorities
  perplexing&mdash;suggestive, indeed, of the wisdom of postponing
  attention to either, until the question of precedence between them is
  settled. And this course will probably appear the more advisable, the
  more closely the fundamental position of the memorialists is
  examined.</p>

  <p>"No opinion of the fact or form of Divine Revelation, founded on
  literary criticism [and I suppose I may add historical, or physical,
  criticism] of the Scriptures themselves, can be admitted to interfere
  with the traditionary testimony of the Church, when that has been once
  ascertained and verified by appeal to antiquity."<a name="NtA3"
  href="#Nt3"><sup>[3]</sup></a></p>

  <p>Grant that it is "the traditionary testimony of the Church" which
  guarantees the canonicity of each and all of the books of the Old and New
  Testaments. Grant also that canonicity means infallibility; yet,
  according to the thirty-eight, this "traditionary <!-- Page 25 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page25"></a>{25}</span>testimony" has to be
  "ascertained and verified by appeal to antiquity." But "ascertainment and
  verification" are purely intellectual processes, which must be conducted
  according to the strict rules of scientific investigation, or be
  self-convicted of worthlessness. Moreover, before we can set about the
  appeal to "antiquity," the exact sense of that usefully vague term must
  be defined by similar means. "Antiquity" may include any number of
  centuries, great or small; and whether "antiquity" is to comprise the
  Council of Trent, or to stop a little beyond that of Nicæa, or to come to
  an end in the time of Irenæus, or in that of Justin Martyr, are knotty
  questions which can be decided, if at all, only by those critical methods
  which the signataries treat so cavalierly. And yet the decision of these
  questions is fundamental, for as the limits of the canonical scriptures
  vary, so may the dogmas deduced from them require modification.
  Christianity is one thing, if the fourth Gospel, the Epistle to the
  Hebrews, the pastoral Epistles, and the Apocalypse are canonical and (by
  the hypothesis) infallibly true; and another thing, if they are not. As I
  have already said, whoso defines the canon defines the creed.</p>

  <p>Now it is quite certain with respect to some of these books, such as
  the Apocalypse and the Epistle to the Hebrews, that the Eastern and the
  Western Church differed in opinion for centuries; and yet neither the one
  branch, nor the other, can have considered its judgment infallible, since
  they eventually agreed to a transaction, by which each gave up its <!--
  Page 26 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page26"></a>{26}</span>objection to the book patronised by the
  other. Moreover, the "fathers" argue (in a more or less rational manner)
  about the canonicity of this or that book, and are by no means above
  producing evidence, internal and external, in favour of the opinions they
  advocate. In fact, imperfect as their conceptions of scientific method
  may be, they not unfrequently used it to the best of their ability. Thus
  it would appear that though science, like Nature, may be driven out with
  a fork, ecclesiastical or other, yet she surely comes back again. The
  appeal to "antiquity" is, in fact, an appeal to science, first to define
  what antiquity is; secondly, to determine what "antiquity," so defined,
  says about canonicity; thirdly, to prove that canonicity means
  infallibility. And when science, largely in the shape of the abhorred
  "criticism," has done this, and has shown that "antiquity" used her own
  methods, however clumsily and imperfectly, she naturally turns round upon
  the appealers to "antiquity," and demands that they should show cause
  why, in these days, science should not resume the work the ancients did
  so imperfectly, and carry it out efficiently.</p>

  <p>But no such cause can be shown. If "antiquity" permitted Eusebius,
  Origen, Tertullian, Irenæus, to argue for the reception of this book into
  the canon and the rejection of that, upon rational grounds, "antiquity"
  admitted the whole principle of modern criticism. If Irenæus produces
  ridiculous reasons for limiting the Gospels to four, it was open to any
  one else to produce good reasons (if he had them) for cutting them down
  to three, or increasing them to <!-- Page 27 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page27"></a>{27}</span>five. If the Eastern branch of the Church
  had a right to reject the Apocalypse and accept the Epistle to the
  Hebrews, and the Western an equal right to accept the Apocalypse and
  reject the Epistle, down to the fourth century, any other branch would
  have an equal right, on cause shown, to reject both, or, as the Catholic
  Church afterwards actually did, to accept both.</p>

  <p>Thus I cannot but think that the thirty-eight are hoist with their own
  petard. Their "appeal to antiquity" turns out to be nothing but a
  round-about way of appealing to the tribunal, the jurisdiction of which
  they affect to deny. Having rested the world of Christian supernaturalism
  on the elephant of biblical infallibility, and furnished the elephant
  with standing ground on the tortoise of "antiquity," they, like their
  famous Hindoo analogue, have been content to look no further; and have
  thereby been spared the horror of discovering that the tortoise rests on
  a grievously fragile construction, to a great extent the work of that
  very intellectual operation which they anathematise and repudiate.</p>

  <p>Moreover, there is another point to be considered. It is of course
  true that a Christian Church (whether the Christian Church, or not,
  depends on the connotation of the definite article) existed before the
  Christian scriptures; and that the infallibility of these depends upon
  the infallibility of the judgment of the persons who selected the books,
  of which they are composed, out of the mass of literature current among
  the early Christians. The logical acumen of Augustine showed him that the
  authority of the Gospel he preached <!-- Page 28 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page28"></a>{28}</span>must rest on that of the
  Church to which he belonged.<a name="NtA4" href="#Nt4"><sup>[4]</sup></a>
  But it is no less true that the Hebrew and the Septuagint versions of
  most, if not all, of the Old Testament books existed before the birth of
  Jesus of Nazareth; and that their divine authority is presupposed by, and
  therefore can hardly depend upon, the religious body constituted by his
  disciples. As everybody knows, the very conception of a "Christ" is
  purely Jewish. The validity of the argument from the Messianic prophecies
  vanishes unless their infallible authority is granted; and, as a matter
  of fact, whether we turn to the Gospels, the Epistles, or the writings of
  the early Apologists, the Jewish scriptures are recognised as the highest
  court of appeal of the Christian.</p>

  <p>The proposal to cite Christian "antiquity" as a witness to the
  infallibility of the Old Testament, when its own claims to authority
  vanish, if certain propositions contained in the Old Testament are
  erroneous, hardly satisfies the requirements of lay logic. It is as if a
  claimant to be sole legatee, under another kind of testament, should
  offer his assertion as sufficient evidence of the validity of the will.
  And, even were not such a circular, or rather rotatory, argument, that
  the infallibility of the Bible is testified by the infallible Church,
  whose infallibility is testified by the infallible Bible, too absurd for
  serious consideration, it remains permissible to ask; Where and when the
  Church, during the period of its infallibility, as <!-- Page 29 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page29"></a>{29}</span>limited by Anglican
  dogmatic necessities, has officially decreed the "actual historical truth
  of all records" in the Old Testament? Was Augustine heretical when he
  denied the actual historical truth of the record of the Creation? Father
  Suarez, standing on later Roman tradition, may have a right to declare
  that he was; but it does not lie in the mouth of those who limit their
  appeal to that early "antiquity," in which Augustine played so great a
  part, to say so.</p>

  <p>&nbsp;</p>

  <p>Among the watchers of the course of the world of thought, some view
  with delight and some with horror, the recrudescence of Supernaturalism
  which manifests itself among us, in shapes ranged along the whole flight
  of steps, which, in this case, separates the sublime from the
  ridiculous&mdash;from Neo-Catholicism and Inner-light mysticism, at the
  top, to unclean things, not worthy of mention in the same breath, at the
  bottom. In my poor opinion, the importance of these manifestations is
  often greatly over-estimated. The extant forms of Supernaturalism have
  deep roots in human nature, and will undoubtedly die hard; but, in these
  latter days, they have to cope with an enemy whose full strength is only
  just beginning to be put out, and whose forces, gathering strength year
  by year, are hemming them round on every side. This enemy is Science, in
  the acceptation of systematised natural knowledge, which, during the last
  two centuries, has extended those methods of investigation, the worth of
  which is confirmed by daily appeal to Nature, to every <!-- Page 30
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page30"></a>{30}</span>region in which
  the Supernatural has hitherto been recognised.</p>

  <p>When scientific historical criticism reduced the annals of heroic
  Greece and of regal Rome to the level of fables; when the unity of
  authorship of the <i>Iliad</i> was successfully assailed by scientific
  literary criticism; when scientific physical criticism, after exploding
  the geocentric theory of the universe, and reducing the solar system
  itself to one of millions of groups of like cosmic specks, circling, at
  unimaginable distances from one another, through infinite space, showed
  the supernaturalistic theories of the duration of the earth and of life
  upon it, to be as inadequate as those of its relative dimensions and
  importance had been; it needed no prophetic gift to see that, sooner or
  later, the Jewish and the early Christian records would be treated in the
  same manner; that the authorship of the Hexateuch and of the Gospels
  would be as severely tested; and that the evidence in favour of the
  veracity of many of the statements found in the Scriptures would have to
  be strong indeed, if they were to be opposed to the conclusions of
  physical science. In point of fact, so far as I can discover, no one
  competent to judge of the evidential strength of these conclusions,
  ventures now to say that the biblical accounts of the creation and of the
  deluge are true in the natural sense of the words of the narratives. The
  most the modern Reconciler ventures upon is to affirm, that some quite
  different sense may be put upon the words; and that this non-natural
  sense may, with a little trouble, be manipulated <!-- Page 31 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page31"></a>{31}</span>into some sort of
  non-contradiction of scientific truth.</p>

  <p>My purpose, in the essay (XVI.) which treats of the narrative of the
  Deluge, was to prove, by physical criticism, that no such event as that
  described ever took place; to exhibit the untrustworthy character of the
  narrative demonstrated by literary criticism; and, finally, to account
  for its origin, by producing a form of those ancient legends of pagan
  Chaldæa, from which the biblical compilation is manifestly derived. I
  have yet to learn that the main propositions of this essay can be
  seriously challenged.</p>

  <p>In the essays (II., III.) on the narrative of the Creation, I have
  endeavoured to controvert the assertion that modern science supports,
  either the interpretation put upon it by Mr. Gladstone, or any
  interpretation which is compatible with the general sense of the
  narrative, quite apart from particular details. The first chapter of
  Genesis teaches the supernatural creation of the present forms of life;
  modern science teaches that they have come about by evolution. The first
  chapter of Genesis teaches the successive origin&mdash;firstly, of all
  the plants, secondly, of all the aquatic and aerial animals, thirdly, of
  all the terrestrial animals, which now exist&mdash;during distinct
  intervals of time; modern science teaches that, throughout all the
  duration of an immensely long past, so far as we have any adequate
  knowledge of it (that is as far back as the Silurian epoch), plants,
  aquatic, aerial, and terrestrial animals have <!-- Page 32 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page32"></a>{32}</span>co-existed; that the
  earliest known are unlike those which at present exist; and that the
  modern species have come into existence as the last terms of a series,
  the members of which have appeared one after another. Thus, far from
  confirming the account in Genesis, the results of modern science, so far
  as they go, are in principle, as in detail, hopelessly discordant with
  it.</p>

  <p>Yet, if the pretensions to infallibility set up, not by the ancient
  Hebrew writings themselves, but by the ecclesiastical champions and
  friends from whom they may well pray to be delivered, thus shatter
  themselves against the rock of natural knowledge, in respect of the two
  most important of all events, the origin of things and the palingenesis
  of terrestrial life, what historical credit dare any serious thinker
  attach to the narratives of the fabrication of Eve, of the Fall, of the
  commerce between the <i>Bene Elohim</i> and the daughters of men, which
  lie between the creational and the diluvial legends? And, if these are to
  lose all historical worth, what becomes of the infallibility of those
  who, according to the later scriptures, have accepted them, argued from
  them, and staked far-reaching dogmatic conclusions upon their historical
  accuracy?</p>

  <p>It is the merest ostrich policy for contemporary ecclesiasticism to
  try to hide its Hexateuchal head&mdash;in the hope that the inseparable
  connection of its body with pre-Abrahamic legends may be overlooked. The
  question will still be asked, if the first nine chapters of the
  Pentateuch are unhistorical, how is <!-- Page 33 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page33"></a>{33}</span>the historical accuracy
  of the remainder to be guaranteed? What more intrinsic claim has the
  story of the Exodus than that of the Deluge, to belief? If God did not
  walk in the Garden of Eden, how can we be assured that he spoke from
  Sinai?</p>

  <p>&nbsp;</p>

  <p>In some other of the following essays (IX., X., XI., XII., XIV., XV.)
  I have endeavoured to show that sober and well-founded physical and
  literary criticism plays no less havoc with the doctrine that the
  canonical scriptures of the New Testament "declare incontrovertibly the
  actual historical truth in all records." We are told that the Gospels
  contain a true revelation of the spiritual world&mdash;a proposition
  which, in one sense of the word "spiritual," I should not think it
  necessary to dispute. But, when it is taken to signify that everything we
  are told about the world of spirits in these books is infallibly true;
  that we are bound to accept the demonology which constitutes an
  inseparable part of their teaching; and to profess belief in a
  Supernaturalism as gross as that of any primitive people&mdash;it is at
  any rate permissible to ask why? Science may be unable to define the
  limits of possibility, but it cannot escape from the moral obligation to
  weigh the evidence in favour of any alleged wonderful occurrence; and I
  have endeavoured to show that the evidence for the Gadarene miracle is
  altogether worthless. We have simply three, partially discrepant,
  versions of a story, about the primitive form, the origin, and the
  authority for which we know absolutely nothing. But the <!-- Page 34
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page34"></a>{34}</span>evidence in
  favour of the Gadarene miracle is as good as that for any other.</p>

  <p>Elsewhere, I have pointed out that it is utterly beside the mark to
  declaim against these conclusions on the ground of their asserted
  tendency to deprive mankind of the consolations of the Christian faith,
  and to destroy the foundations of morality; still less to brand them with
  the question-begging vituperative appellation of "infidelity." The point
  is not whether they are wicked; but, whether, from the point of view of
  scientific method, they are irrefragably true. If they are, they will be
  accepted in time, whether they are wicked, or not wicked. Nature, so far
  as we have been able to attain to any insight into her ways, recks little
  about consolation and makes for righteousness by very round-about paths.
  And, at any rate, whatever may be possible for other people, it is
  becoming less and less possible for the man who puts his faith in
  scientific methods of ascertaining truth, and is accustomed to have that
  faith justified by daily experience, to be consciously false to his
  principle in any matter. But the number of such men, driven into the use
  of scientific methods of inquiry and taught to trust them, by their
  education, their daily professional and business needs, is increasing and
  will continually increase. The phraseology of Supernaturalism may remain
  on men's lips, but in practice they are Naturalists. The magistrate who
  listens with devout attention to the precept "Thou shalt not suffer a
  witch to live" on Sunday, on Monday, dismisses, as intrinsically absurd,
  a charge <!-- Page 35 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page35"></a>{35}</span>of bewitching a cow brought against some old
  woman; the superintendent of a lunatic asylum who substituted exorcism
  for rational modes of treatment would have but a short tenure of office;
  even parish clerks doubt the utility of prayers for rain, so long as the
  wind is in the east; and an outbreak of pestilence sends men, not to the
  churches, but to the drains. In spite of prayers for the success of our
  arms and <i>Te Deums</i> for victory, our real faith is in big battalions
  and keeping our powder dry; in knowledge of the science of warfare; in
  energy, courage, and discipline. In these, as in all other practical
  affairs, we act on the aphorism "<i>Laborare est orare</i>"; we admit
  that intelligent work is the only acceptable worship; and that, whether
  there be a Supernature or not, our business is with Nature.</p>

  <p>&nbsp;</p>

  <p>It is important to note that the principle of the scientific
  Naturalism of the latter half of the nineteenth century, in which the
  intellectual movement of the Renascence has culminated, and which was
  first clearly formulated by Descartes, leads not to the denial of the
  existence of any Supernature;<a name="NtA5"
  href="#Nt5"><sup>[5]</sup></a> but simply to the denial of the validity
  of the evidence adduced in favour of this, or of that, extant form of
  Supernaturalism.</p>

<p><!-- Page 36 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page36"></a>{36}</span></p>

  <p>Looking at the matter from the most rigidly scientific point of view,
  the assumption that, amidst the myriads of worlds scattered through
  endless space, there can be no intelligence, as much greater than man's
  as his is greater than a blackbeetle's; no being endowed with powers of
  influencing the course of nature as much greater than his, as his is
  greater than a snail's, seems to me not merely baseless, but impertinent.
  Without stepping beyond the analogy of that which is known, it is easy to
  people the cosmos with entities, in ascending scale, until we reach
  something practically indistinguishable from omnipotence, omnipresence,
  and omniscience. If our intelligence can, in some matters, surely
  reproduce the past of thousands of years ago and anticipate the future,
  thousands of years hence, it is clearly within the limits of possibility
  that some greater intellect, even of the same order, may be able to
  mirror the whole past and the whole future; if the universe is penetrated
  by a medium of such a nature that a magnetic needle on the earth answers
  to a commotion in the sun, an omnipresent agent is also conceivable; if
  our insignificant knowledge gives us some influence over events,
  practical omniscience may confer indefinably greater power. Finally, if
  evidence that a thing may be, were equivalent to proof that it is,
  analogy might justify the construction of a naturalistic theology and
  demonology not less wonderful than the current supernatural; just as it
  might justify the peopling of Mars, or of Jupiter, with living forms to
  which terrestrial biology offers no <!-- Page 37 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page37"></a>{37}</span>parallel. Until human
  life is longer and the duties of the present press less heavily, I do not
  think that wise men will occupy themselves with Jovian, or Martian,
  natural history; and they will probably agree to a verdict of "not
  proven" in respect of naturalistic theology; taking refuge in that
  agnostic confession, which appears to me to be the only position for
  people who object to say that they know what they are quite aware they do
  not know. As to the interests of morality, I am disposed to think that if
  mankind could be got to act up to this last principle in every relation
  of life, a reformation would be effected such as the world has not yet
  seen; an approximation to the millennium, such as no supernaturalistic
  religion has ever yet succeeded, or seems likely ever to succeed, in
  effecting.</p>

  <p>&nbsp;</p>

  <p>I have hitherto dwelt upon scientific Naturalism chiefly in its
  critical and destructive aspect. But the present incarnation of the
  spirit of the Renascence differs from its predecessor in the eighteenth
  century, in that it builds up, as well as pulls down.</p>

  <p>That of which it has laid the foundation, of which it is already
  raising the superstructure, is the doctrine of evolution. But so many
  strange misconceptions are current about this doctrine&mdash;it is
  attacked on such false grounds by its enemies, and made to cover so much
  that is disputable by some of its friends, that I think it well to define
  as clearly as I can, what I do not and what I do understand by the
  doctrine. <!-- Page 38 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page38"></a>{38}</span></p>

  <p>I have nothing to say to any "Philosophy of Evolution." Attempts to
  construct such a philosophy may be as useful, nay, even as admirable, as
  was the attempt of Descartes to get at a theory of the universe by the
  same <i>à priori</i> road; but, in my judgment, they are as premature.
  Nor, for this purpose, have I to do with any theory of the "Origin of
  Species," much as I value that which is known as the Darwinian theory.
  That the doctrine of natural selection presupposes evolution is quite
  true; but it is not true that evolution necessarily implies natural
  selection. In fact, evolution might conceivably have taken place, without
  the development of groups possessing the characters of species.</p>

  <p>For me, the doctrine of evolution is no speculation, but a
  generalisation of certain facts, which may be observed by any one who
  will take the necessary trouble. These facts are those which are classed
  by biologists under the heads of Embryology and of Palæontology.
  Embryology proves that every higher form of individual life becomes what
  it is by a process of gradual differentiation from an extremely low form;
  palæontology proves, in some cases, and renders probable in all, that the
  oldest types of a group are the lowest; and that they have been followed
  by a gradual succession of more and more differentiated forms. It is
  simply a fact, that evolution of the individual animal and plant is
  taking place, as a natural process, in millions and millions of cases
  every day; it is a fact, that the species which have succeeded one
  another in the past, do, in many <!-- Page 39 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page39"></a>{39}</span>cases, present just those morphological
  relations, which they must possess, if they had proceeded, one from the
  other, by an analogous process of evolution.</p>

  <p>The alternative presented, therefore, is: either the forms of one and
  the same type&mdash;say, <i>e.g.</i>, that of the Horse tribe<a
  name="NtA6" href="#Nt6"><sup>[6]</sup></a>&mdash;arose successively, but
  independently of one another, at intervals, during myriads of years; or,
  the later forms are modified descendants of the earlier. And the latter
  supposition is so vastly more probable than the former, that rational men
  will adopt it, unless satisfactory evidence to the contrary can be
  produced. The objection sometimes put forward, that no one yet professes
  to have seen one species pass into another, comes oddly from those who
  believe that mankind are all descended from Adam. Has any one then yet
  seen the production of negroes from a white stock, or <i>vice versa</i>?
  Moreover, is it absolutely necessary to have watched every step of the
  progress of a planet, to be justified in concluding that it really does
  go round the sun? If so, astronomy is in a bad way.</p>

  <p>I do not, for a moment, presume to suggest that some one, far better
  acquainted than I am with astronomy and physics; or that a master of the
  new chemistry, with its extraordinary revelations; or that a student of
  the development of human society, of language, and of religions, may not
  find a sufficient foundation for the doctrine of evolution in these
  several regions. <!-- Page 40 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page40"></a>{40}</span>On the contrary, I rejoice to see that
  scientific investigation, in all directions, is tending to the same
  result. And it may well be, that it is only my long occupation with
  biological matters that leads me to feel safer among them than anywhere
  else. Be that as it may, I take my stand on the facts of embryology and
  of palæontology; and I hold that our present knowledge of these facts is
  sufficiently thorough and extensive to justify the assertion that all
  future philosophical and theological speculations will have to
  accommodate themselves to some such common body of established truths as
  the following:&mdash;</p>

  <p>1. Plants and animals have existed on our planet for many hundred
  thousand, probably millions of years. During this time, their forms, or
  species, have undergone a succession of changes, which eventually gave
  rise to the species which constitute the present living population of the
  earth. There is no evidence, nor any reason to suspect, that this secular
  process of evolution is other than a part of the ordinary course of
  nature; there is no more ground for imagining the occurrence of
  supernatural intervention, at any moment in the development of species in
  the past, than there is for supposing such intervention to take place, at
  any moment in the development of an individual animal or plant, at the
  present day.</p>

  <p>2. At present, every individual animal or plant commences its
  existence as an organism of extremely simple anatomical structure; and it
  acquires all the complexity it ultimately possesses by gradual <!-- Page
  41 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page41"></a>{41}</span>differentiation into parts of various
  structure and function. When a series of specific forms of the same type,
  extending over a long period of past time, is examined, the relation
  between the earlier and the later forms is analogous to that between
  earlier and later stages of individual development. Therefore, it is a
  probable conclusion that, if we could follow living beings back to their
  earliest states, we should find them to present forms similar to those of
  the individual germ, or, what comes to the same thing, of those lowest
  known organisms which stand upon the boundary line between plants and
  animals. At present, our knowledge of the ancient living world stops very
  far short of this point.</p>

  <p>3. It is generally agreed, and there is certainly no evidence to the
  contrary, that all plants are devoid of consciousness; that they neither
  feel, desire, nor think. It is conceivable that the evolution of the
  primordial living substance should have taken place only along the plant
  line. In that case, the result might have been a wealth of vegetable
  life, as great, perhaps as varied, as at present, though certainly widely
  different from the present flora, in the evolution of which animals have
  played so great a part. But the living world thus constituted would be
  simply an admirable piece of unconscious machinery, the working out of
  which lay potentially in its primitive composition; pleasure and pain
  would have no place in it; it would be a veritable Garden of Eden without
  any tree of the knowledge of good and evil. The question of the moral
  government of such a world <!-- Page 42 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page42"></a>{42}</span>could no more be asked, than we could
  reasonably seek for a moral purpose in a kaleidoscope.</p>

  <p>4. How far down the scale of animal life the phenomena of
  consciousness are manifested, it is impossible to say. No one doubts
  their presence in his fellow-men; and, unless any strict Cartesians are
  left, no one doubts that mammals and birds are to be reckoned creatures
  that have feelings analogous to our smell, taste, sight, hearing, touch,
  pleasure, and pain. For my own part, I should be disposed to extend this
  analogical judgment a good deal further. On the other hand, if the lowest
  forms of plants are to be denied consciousness, I do not see on what
  ground it is to be ascribed to the lowest animals. I find it hard to
  believe that an infusory animalcule, a foraminifer, or a fresh-water
  polype is capable of feeling; and, in spite of Shakspere, I have doubts
  about the great sensitiveness of the "poor beetle that we tread upon."
  The question is equally perplexing when we turn to the stages of
  development of the individual. Granted a fowl feels; that the chick just
  hatched feels; that the chick when it chirps within the egg may possibly
  feel; what is to be said of it, on the fifth day, when the bird is there,
  but with all its tissues nascent? Still more, on the first day, when it
  is nothing but a flat cellular disk? I certainly cannot bring myself to
  believe that this disk feels. Yet if it does not, there must be some time
  in the three weeks, between the first day and the day of hatching, when,
  as a concomitant, or a consequence, of the attainment by the brain of
  <!-- Page 43 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page43"></a>{43}</span>the
  chick of a certain stage of structural evolution, consciousness makes its
  appearance. I have frequently expressed my incapacity to understand the
  nature of the relation between consciousness and a certain anatomical
  tissue, which is thus established by observation. But the fact remains
  that, so far as observation and experiment go, they teach us that the
  psychical phenomena are dependent on the physical.</p>

  <p>In like manner, if fishes, insects, scorpions, and such animals as the
  pearly nautilus, possess feeling, then undoubtedly consciousness was
  present in the world as far back as the Silurian epoch. But, if the
  earliest animals were similar to our rhizopods and monads, there must
  have been some time, between the much earlier epoch in which they
  constituted the whole animal population and the Silurian, in which
  feeling dawned, in consequence of the organism having reached the stage
  of evolution on which it depends.</p>

  <p>5. Consciousness has various forms, which may be manifested
  independently of one another. The feelings of light and colour, of sound,
  of touch, though so often associated with those of pleasure and pain,
  are, by nature, as entirely independent of them as is thinking. An animal
  devoid of the feelings of pleasure and of pain, may nevertheless exhibit
  all the effects of sensation and purposive action. Therefore, it would be
  a justifiable hypothesis that, long after organic evolution had attained
  to consciousness, pleasure and pain were still absent. Such a world <!--
  Page 44 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page44"></a>{44}</span>would be
  without either happiness or misery; no act could be punished and none
  could be rewarded; and it could have no moral purpose.</p>

  <p>6. Suppose, for argument's sake, that all mammals and birds are
  subjects of pleasure and pain. Then we may be certain that these forms of
  consciousness were in existence at the beginning of the Mesozoic epoch.
  From that time forth, pleasure has been distributed without reference to
  merit, and pain inflicted without reference to demerit, throughout all
  but a mere fraction of the higher animals. Moreover, the amount and the
  severity of the pain, no less than the variety and acuteness of the
  pleasure, have increased with every advance in the scale of evolution. As
  suffering came into the world, not in consequence of a fall, but of a
  rise, in the scale of being, so every further rise has brought more
  suffering. As the evidence stands, it would appear that the sort of brain
  which characterises the highest mammals and which, so far as we know, is
  the indispensable condition of the highest sensibility, did not come into
  existence before the Tertiary epoch. The primordial anthropoid was
  probably, in this respect, on much the same footing as his pithecoid kin.
  Like them he stood upon his "natural rights," gratified all his desires
  to the best of his ability, and was as incapable of either right or wrong
  doing as they. It would be as absurd as in their case, to regard his
  pleasures, any more than theirs, as moral rewards, and his pains, any
  more than theirs, as moral punishments. <!-- Page 45 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page45"></a>{45}</span></p>

  <p>7. From the remotest ages of which we have any cognizance, death has
  been the natural and, apparently, the necessary concomitant of life. In
  our hypothetical world (3), inhabited by nothing but plants, death must
  have very early resulted from the struggle for existence: many of the
  crowd must have jostled one another out of the conditions on which life
  depends. The occurrence of death, as far back as we have any fossil
  record of life, however, needs not to be proved by such arguments; for,
  if there had been no death there would have been no fossil remains, such
  as the great majority of those we meet with. Not only was there death in
  the world, as far as the record of life takes us; but, ever since mammals
  and birds have been preyed upon by carnivorous animals, there has been
  painful death, inflicted by mechanisms specially adapted for inflicting
  it.</p>

  <p>8. Those who are acquainted with the closeness of the structural
  relations between the human organisation and that of the mammals which
  come nearest to him, on the one hand; and with the palæontological
  history of such animals as horses and dogs, on the other; will not be
  disposed to question the origin of man from forms which stand in the same
  sort of relation to <i>Homo sapiens</i>, as <i>Hipparion</i> does to
  <i>Equus</i>. I think it a conclusion, fully justified by analogy, that,
  sooner or later, we shall discover the remains of our less specialised
  primatic ancestors in the strata which have yielded the less specialised
  equine and canine quadrupeds. At present, fossil remains of men do not
  take us back further than the later <!-- Page 46 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page46"></a>{46}</span>part of the Quaternary
  epoch; and, as was to be expected, they do not differ more from existing
  men, than Quaternary horses differ from existing horses. Still earlier we
  find traces of man, in implements, such as are used by the ruder savages
  at the present day. Later, the remains of the palæolithic and neolithic
  conditions take us gradually from the savage state to the civilisations
  of Egypt and of Mycenæ; though the true chronological order of the
  remains actually discovered may be uncertain.</p>

  <p>9. Much has yet to be learned, but, at present, natural knowledge
  affords no support to the notion that men have fallen from a higher to a
  lower state. On the contrary, everything points to a slow natural
  evolution; which, favoured by the surrounding conditions in such
  localities as the valleys of the Yang-tse-kang, the Euphrates, and the
  Nile, reached a relatively high pitch, five or six thousand years ago;
  while, in many other regions, the savage condition has persisted down to
  our day. In all this vast lapse of time there is not a trace of the
  occurrence of any general destruction of the human race; not the smallest
  indication that man has been treated on any other principles than the
  rest of the animal world.</p>

  <p>10. The results of the process of evolution in the case of man, and in
  that of his more nearly allied contemporaries, have been marvellously
  different. Yet it is easy to see that small primitive differences of a
  certain order, must, in the long run, bring about a wide divergence of
  the human stock from the others. <!-- Page 47 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page47"></a>{47}</span>It is a reasonable supposition that, in the
  earliest human organisms, an improved brain, a voice more capable of
  modulation and articulation, limbs which lent themselves better to
  gesture, a more perfect hand, capable among other things of imitating
  form in plastic or other material, were combined with the curiosity, the
  mimetic tendency, the strong family affection, of the next lower group;
  and that they were accompanied by exceptional length of life and a
  prolonged minority. The last two peculiarities are obviously calculated
  to strengthen the family organisation, and to give great weight to its
  educative influences. The potentiality of language, as the vocal symbol
  of thought, lay in the faculty of modulating and articulating the voice.
  The potentiality of writing, as the visual symbol of thought, lay in the
  hand that could draw; and in the mimetic tendency, which, as we know, was
  gratified by drawing, as far back as the days of Quaternary man. With
  speech as the record, in tradition, of the experience of more than one
  generation; with writing as the record of that of any number of
  generations; the experience of the race, tested and corrected generation
  after generation, could be stored up and made the starting point for
  fresh progress. Having these perfectly natural factors of the
  evolutionary process in man before us, it seems unnecessary to go further
  a-field in search of others.</p>

  <p>11. That the doctrine of evolution implies a former state of innocence
  of mankind is quite true; but, as I have remarked, it is the innocence of
  the ape and of <!-- Page 48 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page48"></a>{48}</span>the tiger, whose acts, however they may run
  counter to the principles of morality, it would be absurd to blame. The
  lust of the one and the ferocity of the other are as much provided for in
  their organisation, are as clear evidences of design, as any other
  features that can be named.</p>

  <p>Observation and experiment upon the phenomena of society soon taught
  men that, in order to obtain the advantages of social existence, certain
  rules must be observed. Morality commenced with society. Society is
  possible only upon the condition that the members of it shall surrender
  more or less of their individual freedom of action. In primitive
  societies, individual selfishness is a centrifugal force of such
  intensity that it is constantly bringing the social organisation to the
  verge of destruction. Hence the prominence of the positive rules of
  obedience to the elders; of standing by the family or the tribe in all
  emergencies; of fulfilling the religious rites, non-observance of which
  is conceived to damage it with the supernatural powers, belief in whose
  existence is one of the earliest products of human thought; and of the
  negative rules, which restrain each from meddling with the life or
  property of another.</p>

  <p>12. The highest conceivable form of human society is that in which the
  desire to do what is best for the whole, dominates and limits the action
  of every member of that society. The more complex the social organisation
  the greater the number of acts from which each man must abstain, if he
  desires to do that which is best for all. Thus the progressive <!-- Page
  49 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page49"></a>{49}</span>evolution of
  society means increasing restriction of individual freedom in certain
  directions.</p>

  <p>With the advance of civilisation, and the growth of cities and of
  nations by the coalescence of families and of tribes, the rules which
  constitute the common foundation of morality and of law became more
  numerous and complicated, and the temptations to break or evade many of
  them stronger. In the absence of a clear apprehension of the natural
  sanctions of these rules, a supernatural sanction was assumed; and
  imagination supplied the motives which reason was supposed to be
  incompetent to furnish. Religion, at first independent of morality,
  gradually took morality under its protection; and the supernaturalists
  have ever since tried to persuade mankind that the existence of ethics is
  bound up with that of supernaturalism.</p>

  <p>I am not of that opinion. But, whether it is correct or otherwise, it
  is very clear to me that, as Beelzebub is not to be cast out by the aid
  of Beelzebub, so morality is not to be established by immorality. It is,
  we are told, the special peculiarity of the devil that he was a liar from
  the beginning. If we set out in life with pretending to know that which
  we do not know; with professing to accept for proof evidence which we are
  well aware is inadequate; with wilfully shutting our eyes and our ears to
  facts which militate against this or that comfortable hypothesis; we are
  assuredly doing our best to deserve the same character.</p>

  <p>&nbsp;</p>

  <p>I have not the presumption to imagine that, in <!-- Page 50 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page50"></a>{50}</span>spite of all my efforts,
  errors may not have crept into these propositions. But I am tolerably
  confident that time will prove them to be substantially correct. And if
  they are so, I confess I do not see how any extant supernaturalistic
  system can also claim exactness. That they are irreconcilable with the
  biblical cosmogony, anthropology, and theodicy is obvious; but they are
  no less inconsistent with the sentimental Deism of the "Vicaire Savoyard"
  and his numerous modern progeny. It is as impossible, to my mind, to
  suppose that the evolutionary process was set going with full
  foreknowledge of the result and yet with what we should understand by a
  purely benevolent intention, as it is to imagine that the intention was
  purely malevolent. And the prevalence of dualistic theories from the
  earliest times to the present day&mdash;whether in the shape of the
  doctrine of the inherently evil nature of matter; of an Ahriman; of a
  hard and cruel Demiurge; of a diabolical "prince of this world," show how
  widely this difficulty has been felt.</p>

  <p>Many seem to think that, when it is admitted that the ancient
  literature, contained in our Bibles, has no more claim to infallibility
  than any other ancient literature; when it is proved that the Israelites
  and their Christian successors accepted a great many supernaturalistic
  theories and legends which have no better foundation than those of
  heathenism, nothing remains to be done but to throw the Bible aside as so
  much waste paper.</p>

  <p>I have always opposed this opinion. It appears to <!-- Page 51
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page51"></a>{51}</span>me that if there
  is anybody more objectionable than the orthodox Bibliolater it is the
  heterodox Philistine, who can discover in a literature which, in some
  respects, has no superior, nothing but a subject for scoffing and an
  occasion for the display of his conceited ignorance of the debt he owes
  to former generations.</p>

  <p>Twenty-two years ago I pleaded for the use of the Bible as an
  instrument of popular education, and I venture to repeat what I then
  said:</p>

  <p>"Consider the great historical fact that, for three centuries, this
  book has been woven into the life of all that is best and noblest in
  English history; that it has become the national epic of Britain and is
  as familiar to gentle and simple, from John o' Groat's House to Land's
  End, as Dante and Tasso once were to the Italians; that it is written in
  the noblest and purest English and abounds in exquisite beauties of mere
  literary form; and, finally, that it forbids the veriest hind, who never
  left his village, to be ignorant of the existence of other countries and
  other civilisations and of a great past, stretching back to the furthest
  limits of the oldest nations in the world. By the study of what other
  book could children be so much humanised and made to feel that each
  figure in that vast historical procession fills, like themselves, but a
  momentary space in the interval between the Eternities; and earns the
  blessings or the curses of all time, according to its effort to do good
  and hate evil, even as they also are earning their payment for their
  work?"<a name="NtA7" href="#Nt7"><sup>[7]</sup></a></p>

<p><!-- Page 52 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page52"></a>{52}</span></p>

  <p>At the same time, I laid stress upon the necessity of placing such
  instruction in lay hands; in the hope and belief, that it would thus
  gradually accommodate itself to the coming changes of opinion; that the
  theology and the legend would drop more and more out of sight, while the
  perennially interesting historical, literary, and ethical contents would
  come more and more into view.</p>

  <p>I may add yet another claim of the Bible to the respect and the
  attention of a democratic age. Throughout the history of the western
  world, the Scriptures, Jewish and Christian, have been the great
  instigators of revolt against the worst forms of clerical and political
  despotism. The Bible has been the <i>Magna Charta</i> of the poor and of
  the oppressed; down to modern times, no State has had a constitution in
  which the interests of the people are so largely taken into account, in
  which the duties, so much more than the privileges, of rulers are
  insisted upon, as that drawn up for Israel in Deuteronomy and in
  Leviticus; nowhere is the fundamental truth that the welfare of the
  State, in the long run, depends on the uprightness of the citizen so
  strongly laid down. Assuredly, the Bible talks no trash about the rights
  of man; but it insists on the equality of duties, on the liberty to bring
  about that righteousness which is somewhat different from struggling for
  "rights;" on the fraternity of taking thought for one's neighbour as for
  oneself.</p>

  <p>So far as such equality, liberty, and fraternity are included under
  the democratic principles which assume the same names, the Bible is the
  most <!-- Page 53 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page53"></a>{53}</span>democratic book in the world. As such it
  began, through the heretical sects, to undermine the clerico-political
  despotism of the middle ages, almost as soon as it was formed, in the
  eleventh century; Pope and King had as much as they could do to put down
  the Albigenses and the Waldenses in the twelfth and thirteenth centuries;
  the Lollards and the Hussites gave them still more trouble in the
  fourteenth and fifteenth; from the sixteenth century onward, the
  Protestant sects have favoured political freedom in proportion to the
  degree in which they have refused to acknowledge any ultimate authority
  save that of the Bible.</p>

  <p>But the enormous influence which has thus been exerted by the Jewish
  and Christian Scriptures has had no necessary connection with
  cosmogonies, demonologies, and miraculous interferences. Their strength
  lies in their appeals, not to the reason, but to the ethical sense. I do
  not say that even the highest biblical ideal is exclusive of others or
  needs no supplement. But I do believe that the human race is not yet,
  possibly may never be, in a position to dispense with it.</p>

<h3>I</h3>

<h3>THE RISE AND PROGRESS OF PALÆONTOLOGY</h3>

  <p>That application of the sciences of biology and geology, which is
  commonly known as palæontology, took its origin in the mind of the first
  person who, finding something like a shell, or a bone, naturally embedded
  in gravel or rock, indulged in speculations upon the nature of this thing
  which he had dug out&mdash;this "fossil"&mdash;and upon the causes which
  had brought it into such a position. In this rudimentary form, a high
  antiquity may safely be ascribed to palæontology, inasmuch as we know
  that, 500 years before the Christian era, the philosophic doctrines of
  Xenophanes were influenced by his observations upon the fossil remains
  exposed in the quarries of Syracuse. From this time forth not only the
  philosophers, but the poets, the historians, the geographers of antiquity
  occasionally refer to fossils; and, after the revival of learning, lively
  controversies arose respecting their real nature. But hardly more than
  two centuries have elapsed since this fundamental problem was first
  exhaustively treated; it was only in the last century that the
  archæological value of fossils&mdash;their importance, I mean, as records
  of the history of the earth&mdash;was fully <!-- Page 56 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page56"></a>{56}</span>recognised; the first
  adequate investigation of the fossil remains of any large group of
  vertebrated animals is to be found in Cuvier's <i>Recherches sur les
  Ossemens Fossiles</i>, completed in 1822; and, so modern is
  stratigraphical palæontology, that its founder, William Smith, lived to
  receive the just recognition of his services by the award of the first
  Wollaston Medal in 1831.</p>

  <p>But, although palæontology is a comparatively youthful scientific
  speciality, the mass of materials with which it has to deal is already
  prodigious. In the last fifty years the number of known fossil remains of
  invertebrated animals has been trebled or quadrupled. The work of
  interpretation of vertebrate fossils, the foundations of which were so
  solidly laid by Cuvier, was carried on, with wonderful vigour and
  success, by Agassiz in Switzerland, by Von Meyer in Germany, and last,
  but not least, by Owen in this country, while, in later years, a
  multitude of workers have laboured in the same field. In many groups of
  the animal kingdom the number of fossil forms already known is as great
  as that of the existing species. In some cases it is much greater; and
  there are entire orders of animals of the existence of which we should
  know nothing except for the evidence afforded by fossil remains. With all
  this it may be safely assumed that, at the present moment, we are not
  acquainted with a tithe of the fossils which will sooner or later be
  discovered. If we may judge by the profusion yielded within the last few
  years by the Tertiary formations of North America, there seems to be no
  limit to the <!-- Page 57 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page57"></a>{57}</span>multitude of Mammalian remains to be
  expected from that continent; and analogy leads us to expect similar
  riches in Eastern Asia, whenever the Tertiary formations of that region
  are as carefully explored. Again, we have as yet almost everything to
  learn respecting the terrestrial population of the Mesozoic
  epoch&mdash;and it seems as if the Western territories of the United
  States were about to prove as instructive in regard to this point as they
  have in respect of tertiary life. My friend Professor Marsh informs me
  that, within two years, remains of more than 160 distinct individuals of
  mammals, belonging to twenty species and nine genera, have been found in
  a space not larger than the floor of a good-sized room; while beds of the
  same age have yielded 300 reptiles, varying in size from a length of 60
  feet or 80 feet to the dimensions of a rabbit.</p>

  <p>The task which I have set myself to-night is to endeavour to lay
  before you, as briefly as possible, a sketch of the successive steps by
  which our present knowledge of the facts of palæontology and of those
  conclusions from them which are indisputable, has been attained; and I
  beg leave to remind you, at the outset, that in attempting to sketch the
  progress of a branch of knowledge to which innumerable labours have
  contributed, my business is rather with generalisations than with
  details. It is my object to mark the epochs of palæontology, not to
  recount all the events of its history.</p>

  <p>That which I just now called the fundamental problem of palæontology,
  the question which has to be <!-- Page 58 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page58"></a>{58}</span>settled before any other can be profitably
  discussed, is this, What is the nature of fossils? Are they, as the
  healthy common sense of the ancient Greeks appears to have led them to
  assume without hesitation, the remains of animals and plants? Or are
  they, as was so generally maintained in the fifteenth, sixteenth, and
  seventeenth centuries, mere figured stones, portions of mineral matter
  which have assumed the forms of leaves and shells and bones, just as
  those portions of mineral matter which we call crystals take on the form
  of regular geometrical solids? Or, again, are they, as others thought,
  the products of the germs of animals and of the seeds of plants which
  have lost their way, as it were, in the bowels of the earth, and have
  achieved only an imperfect and abortive development? It is easy to sneer
  at our ancestors for being disposed to reject the first in favour of one
  or other of the last two hypotheses; but it is much more profitable to
  try to discover why they, who were really not one whit less sensible
  persons than our excellent selves, should have been led to entertain
  views which strike us as absurd. The belief in what is erroneously called
  spontaneous generation, that is to say, in the development of living
  matter out of mineral matter, apart from the agency of pre-existing
  living matter, as an ordinary occurrence at the present day&mdash;which
  is still held by some of us, was universally accepted as an obvious truth
  by them. They could point to the arborescent forms assumed by hoar-frost
  and by sundry metallic minerals as evidence of the existence in nature of
  a "plastic <!-- Page 59 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page59"></a>{59}</span>force" competent to enable inorganic matter
  to assume the form of organised bodies. Then, as every one who is
  familiar with fossils knows, they present innumerable gradations, from
  shells and bones which exactly resemble the recent objects, to masses of
  mere stone which, however accurately they repeat the outward form of the
  organic body, have nothing else in common with it; and, thence, to mere
  traces and faint impressions in the continuous substance of the rock.
  What we now know to be the results of the chemical changes which take
  place in the course of fossilisation, by which mineral is substituted for
  organic substance, might, in the absence of such knowledge, be fairly
  interpreted as the expression of a process of development in the opposite
  direction&mdash;from the mineral to the organic. Moreover, in an age when
  it would have seemed the most absurd of paradoxes to suggest that the
  general level of the sea is constant, while that of the solid land
  fluctuates up and down through thousands of feet in a secular ground
  swell, it may well have appeared far less hazardous to conceive that
  fossils are sports of nature than to accept the necessary alternative,
  that all the inland regions and highlands, in the rocks of which marine
  shells had been found, had once been covered by the ocean. It is not so
  surprising, therefore, as it may at first seem, that although such men as
  Leonardo da Vinci and Bernard Palissy took just views of the nature of
  fossils, the opinion of the majority of their contemporaries set strongly
  the other way; nor even that error maintained itself long after the <!--
  Page 60 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page60"></a>{60}</span>scientific grounds of the true
  interpretation of fossils had been stated, in a manner that left nothing
  to be desired, in the latter half of the seventeenth century. The person
  who rendered this good service to palæontology was Nicolas Steno,
  professor of anatomy in Florence, though a Dane by birth. Collectors of
  fossils at that day were familiar with certain bodies termed
  "glossopetræ," and speculation was rife as to their nature. In the first
  half of the seventeenth century, Fabio Colonna had tried to convince his
  colleagues of the famous Accademia dei Lincei that the glossopetræ were
  merely fossil sharks' teeth, but his arguments made no impression. Fifty
  years later, Steno reopened the question, and, by dissecting the head of
  a shark and pointing out the very exact correspondence of its teeth with
  the glossopetræ, left no rational doubt as to the origin of the latter.
  Thus far, the work of Steno went little further than that of Colonna, but
  it fortunately occurred to him to think out the whole subject of the
  interpretation of fossils, and the result of his meditations was the
  publication, in 1669, of a little treatise with the very quaint title of
  <i>De Solido intra Solidum naturaliter contento</i>. The general course
  of Steno's argument may be stated in a few words. Fossils are solid
  bodies which, by some natural process, have come to be contained within
  other solid bodies, namely, the rocks in which they are embedded; and the
  fundamental problem of palæontology, stated generally, is this: "Given a
  body endowed with a certain shape and produced in accordance with natural
  laws, to find <!-- Page 61 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page61"></a>{61}</span>in that body itself the evidence of the
  place and manner of its production."<a name="NtA8"
  href="#Nt8"><sup>[8]</sup></a> The only way of solving this problem is by
  the application of the axiom that "like effects imply like causes," or as
  Steno puts it, in reference to this particular case, that "bodies which
  are altogether similar have been produced in the same way."<a name="NtA9"
  href="#Nt9"><sup>[9]</sup></a> Hence, since the glossopetræ are
  altogether similar to sharks' teeth, they must have been produced by
  sharklike fishes; and since many fossil shells correspond, down to the
  minutest details of structure, with the shells of existing marine or
  freshwater animals, they must have been produced by similar animals; and
  the like reasoning is applied by Steno to the fossil bones of vertebrated
  animals, whether aquatic or terrestrial. To the obvious objection that
  many fossils are not altogether similar to their living analogues,
  differing in substance while agreeing in form, or being mere hollows or
  impressions, the surfaces of which are figured in the same way as those
  of animal or vegetable organisms, Steno replies by pointing out the
  changes which take place in organic remains embedded in the earth, and
  how their solid substance may be dissolved away entirely, or replaced by
  mineral matter, until nothing is left of the original but a cast, an
  impression, or a mere trace of its contours. The principles of
  investigation thus excellently stated and illustrated by Steno in 1669,
  are those which have, <!-- Page 62 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page62"></a>{62}</span>consciously or unconsciously, guided the
  researches of palæontologists ever since. Even that feat of palæontology
  which has so powerfully impressed the popular imagination, the
  reconstruction of an extinct animal from a tooth or a bone, is based upon
  the simplest imaginable application of the logic of Steno. A moment's
  consideration will show, in fact, that Steno's conclusion that the
  glossopetræ are sharks' teeth implies the reconstruction of an animal
  from its tooth. It is equivalent to the assertion that the animal of
  which the glossopetræ are relics had the form and organisation of a
  shark; that it had a skull, a vertebral column, and limbs similar to
  those which are characteristic of this group of fishes; that its heart,
  gills, and intestines presented the peculiarities which those of all
  sharks exhibit; nay, even that any hard parts which its integument
  contained were of a totally different character from the scales of
  ordinary fishes. These conclusions are as certain as any based upon
  probable reasonings can be. And they are so, simply because a very large
  experience justifies us in believing that teeth of this particular form
  and structure are invariably associated with the peculiar organisation of
  sharks, and are never found in connection with other organisms. Why this
  should be we are not at present in a position even to imagine; we must
  take the fact as an empirical law of animal morphology, the reason of
  which may possibly be one day found in the history of the evolution of
  the shark tribe, but for which it is hopeless to seek for an explanation
  in ordinary physiological reasonings. Every one <!-- Page 63 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page63"></a>{63}</span>practically acquainted
  with palæontology is aware that it is not every tooth, nor every bone,
  which enables us to form a judgment of the character of the animal to
  which it belonged; and that it is possible to possess many teeth, and
  even a large portion of the skeleton of an extinct animal, and yet be
  unable to reconstruct its skull or its limbs. It is only when the tooth
  or bone presents peculiarities, which we know by previous experience to
  be characteristic of a certain group, that we can safely predict that the
  fossil belonged to an animal of the same group. Any one who finds a cow's
  grinder may be perfectly sure that it belonged to an animal which had two
  complete toes on each foot and ruminated; any one who finds a horse's
  grinder may be as sure that it had one complete toe on each foot and did
  not ruminate; but if ruminants and horses were extinct animals of which
  nothing but the grinders had ever been discovered, no amount of
  physiological reasoning could have enabled us to reconstruct either
  animal, still less to have divined the wide differences between the two.
  Cuvier, in the <i>Discours sur les Révolutions de la Surface du
  Globe</i>, strangely credits himself, and has ever since been credited by
  others, with the invention of a new method of palæontological research.
  But if you will turn to the <i>Recherches sur les Ossemens Fossiles</i>
  and watch Cuvier, not speculating, but working, you will find that his
  method is neither more nor less than that of Steno. If he was able to
  make his famous prophecy from the jaw which lay upon the surface of a
  block of stone to the pelvis of the same animal which lay hidden in it,
  it was not <!-- Page 64 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page64"></a>{64}</span>because either he, or any one else, knew, or
  knows, why a certain form of jaw is, as a rule, constantly accompanied by
  the presence of marsupial bones, but simply because experience has shown
  that these two structures are co-ordinated.</p>

  <p>The settlement of the nature of fossils led at once to the next
  advance of palæontology, viz. its application to the deciphering of the
  history of the earth. When it was admitted that fossils are remains of
  animals and plants, it followed that, in so far as they resemble
  terrestrial, or freshwater, animals and plants, they are evidences of the
  existence of land, or fresh water; and, in so far as they resemble marine
  organisms, they are evidences of the existence of the sea at the time at
  which they were parts of actually living animals and plants. Moreover, in
  the absence of evidence to the contrary, it must be admitted that the
  terrestrial or the marine organisms implied the existence of land or sea
  at the place in which they were found while they were yet living. In
  fact, such conclusions were immediately drawn by everybody, from the time
  of Xenophanes downwards, who believed that fossils were really organic
  remains. Steno discusses their value as evidence of repeated alteration
  of marine and terrestrial conditions upon the soil of Tuscany in a manner
  worthy of a modern geologist. The speculations of De Maillet in the
  beginning of the eighteenth century turn upon fossils; and Buffon follows
  him very closely in those two remarkable works, the <i>Théorie de la
  Terre</i> and the <i>Époques de la Nature</i>, with <!-- Page 65 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page65"></a>{65}</span>which he commenced and
  ended his career as a naturalist.</p>

  <p>The opening sentences of the <i>Époques de la Nature</i> show us how
  fully Buffon recognised the analogy of geological with archæological
  inquiries. "As in civil history we consult deeds, seek for coins, or
  decipher antique inscriptions in order to determine the epochs of human
  revolutions and fix the date of moral events; so, in natural history, we
  must search the archives of the world, recover old monuments from the
  bowels of the earth, collect their fragmentary remains, and gather into
  one body of evidence all the signs of physical change which may enable us
  to look back upon the different ages of nature. It is our only means of
  fixing some points in the immensity of space, and of setting a certain
  number of waymarks along the eternal path of time."</p>

  <p>Buffon enumerates five classes of these monuments of the past history
  of the earth, and they are all facts of palæontology. In the first place,
  he says, shells and other marine productions are found all over the
  surface and in the interior of the dry land; and all calcareous rocks are
  made up of their remains. Secondly, a great many of these shells which
  are found in Europe are not now to be met with in the adjacent seas; and,
  in the slates and other deep-seated deposits, there are remains of fishes
  and of plants of which no species now exist in our latitudes, and which
  are either extinct, or exist only in more northern climates. Thirdly, in
  Siberia and in other northern regions of Europe and of Asia, bones and
  <!-- Page 66 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page66"></a>{66}</span>teeth of elephants, rhinoceroses, and
  hippopotamuses occur in such numbers that these animals must once have
  lived and multiplied in those regions, although at the present day they
  are confined to southern climates. The deposits in which these remains
  are found are superficial, while those which contain shells and other
  marine remains lie much deeper. Fourthly, tusks and bones of elephants
  and hippopotamuses are found not only in the northern regions of the old
  world, but also in those of the new world, although, at present, neither
  elephants nor hippopotamuses occur in America. Fifthly, in the middle of
  the continents, in regions most remote from the sea, we find an infinite
  number of shells, of which the most part belong to animals of those kinds
  which still exist in southern seas, but of which many others have no
  living analogues; so that these species appear to be lost, destroyed by
  some unknown cause. It is needless to inquire how far these statements
  are strictly accurate; they are sufficiently so to justify Buffon's
  conclusions that the dry land was once beneath the sea; that the
  formation of the fossiliferous rocks must have occupied a vastly greater
  lapse of time than that traditionally ascribed to the age of the earth;
  that fossil remains indicate different climatal conditions to have
  obtained in former times, and especially that the polar regions were once
  warmer; that many species of animals and plants have become extinct; and
  that geological change has had something to do with geographical
  distribution.</p>

  <p>But these propositions almost constitute the framework of
  palæontology. In order to complete it but <!-- Page 67 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page67"></a>{67}</span>one addition was needed,
  and that was made, in the last years of the eighteenth century, by
  William Smith, whose work comes so near our own times that many living
  men may have been personally acquainted with him. This modest
  land-surveyor, whose business took him into many parts of England,
  profited by the peculiarly favourable conditions offered by the
  arrangement of our secondary strata to make a careful examination and
  comparison of their fossil contents at different points of the large area
  over which they extend. The result of his accurate and widely-extended
  observations was to establish the important truth that each stratum
  contains certain fossils which are peculiar to it; and that the order in
  which the strata, characterised by these fossils, are superimposed one
  upon the other is always the same. This most important generalisation was
  rapidly verified and extended to all parts of the world accessible to
  geologists; and now it rests upon such an immense mass of observations as
  to be one of the best established truths of natural science. To the
  geologist the discovery was of infinite importance, as it enabled him to
  identify rocks of the same relative age, however their continuity might
  be interrupted or their composition altered. But to the biologist it had
  a still deeper meaning, for it demonstrated that, throughout the
  prodigious duration of time registered by the fossiliferous rocks, the
  living population of the earth had undergone continual changes, not
  merely by the extinction of a certain number of the species which had at
  first existed, but by the continual generation <!-- Page 68 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page68"></a>{68}</span>of new species, and the
  no less constant extinction of old ones.</p>

  <p>Thus the broad outlines of palæontology, in so far as it is the common
  property of both the geologist and the biologist, were marked out at the
  close of the last century. In tracing its subsequent progress I must
  confine myself to the province of biology, and, indeed, to the influence
  of palæontology upon zoological morphology. And I accept this limitation
  the more willingly as the no less important topic of the bearing of
  geology and of palæontology upon distribution has been luminously treated
  in the address of the President of the Geographical Section.<a
  name="NtA10" href="#Nt10"><sup>[10]</sup></a></p>

  <p>The succession of the species of animals and plants in time being
  established, the first question which the zoologist or the botanist had
  to ask himself was, What is the relation of these successive species one
  to another? And it is a curious circumstance that the most important
  event in the history of palæontology which immediately succeeded William
  Smith's generalisation was a discovery which, could it have been rightly
  appreciated at the time, would have gone far towards suggesting the
  answer, which was in fact delayed for more than half a century. I refer
  to Cuvier's investigation of the Mammalian fossils yielded by the
  quarries in the older tertiary rocks of Montmartre, among the chief
  results of which was the bringing to light of two genera of extinct
  hoofed quadrupeds, the <i>Anoplotherium</i> and the <i>Palæotherium</i>.
  The rich materials at Cuvier's disposition enabled him <!-- Page 69
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page69"></a>{69}</span>to obtain a full
  knowledge of the osteology and of the dentition of these two forms, and
  consequently to compare their structure critically with that of existing
  hoofed animals. The effect of this comparison was to prove that the
  <i>Anoplotherium</i>, though it presented many points of resemblance with
  the pigs on the one hand and with the ruminants on the other, differed
  from both to such an extent that it could find a place in neither group.
  In fact, it held, in some respects, an intermediate position, tending to
  bridge over the interval between these two groups, which in the existing
  fauna are so distinct. In the same way, the <i>Palæotherium</i> tended to
  connect forms so different as the tapir, the rhinoceros, and the horse.
  Subsequent investigations have brought to light a variety of facts of the
  same order, the most curious and striking of which are those which prove
  the existence, in the mesozoic epoch, of a series of forms intermediate
  between birds and reptiles&mdash;two classes of vertebrate animals which
  at present appear to be more widely separated than any others. Yet the
  interval between them is completely filled, in the mesozoic fauna, by
  birds which have reptilian characters on the one side, and reptiles which
  have ornithic characters on the other. So again, while the group of
  fishes termed ganoids is at the present time so distinct from that of the
  dipnoi, or mudfishes, that they have been reckoned as distinct orders,
  the Devonian strata present us with forms of which it is impossible to
  say with certainty whether they are dipnoi or whether they are ganoids.
  <!-- Page 70 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page70"></a>{70}</span></p>

  <p>Agassiz's long and elaborate researches upon fossil fishes, published
  between 1833 and 1842, led him to suggest the existence of another kind
  of relation between ancient and modern forms of life. He observed that
  the oldest fishes present many characters which recall the embryonic
  conditions of existing fishes; and that, not only among fishes, but in
  several groups of the invertebrata which have a long palæontological
  history, the latest forms are more modified, more specialised, than the
  earlier. The fact that the dentition of the older tertiary ungulate and
  carnivorous mammals is always complete, noticed by Professor Owen,
  illustrated the same generalisation.</p>

  <p>Another no less suggestive observation was made by Mr. Darwin, whose
  personal investigations during the voyage of the <i>Beagle</i> led him to
  remark upon the singular fact, that the fauna, which immediately precedes
  that at present existing in any geographical province of distribution,
  presents the same peculiarities as its successor. Thus, in South America
  and in Australia, the later tertiary or quaternary fossils show that the
  fauna which immediately preceded that of the present day was, in the one
  case, as much characterised by edentates and, in the other, by marsupials
  as it is now, although the species of the older are largely different
  from those of the newer fauna.</p>

  <p>However clearly these indications might point in one direction, the
  question of the exact relation of the successive forms of animal and
  vegetable life could be satisfactorily settled only in one way; namely,
  by comparing, stage by stage, the series of <!-- Page 71 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page71"></a>{71}</span>forms presented by one
  and the same type throughout a long space of time. Within the last few
  years this has been done fully in the case of the horse, less completely
  in the case of the other principal types of the ungulata and of the
  carnivora; and all these investigations tend to one general result,
  namely, that, in any given series, the successive members of that series
  present a gradually increasing specialisation of structure. That is to
  say, if any such mammal at present existing has specially modified and
  reduced limbs or dentition and complicated brain, its predecessors in
  time show less and less modification and reduction in limbs and teeth and
  a less highly developed brain. The labours of Gaudry, Marsh, and Cope
  furnish abundant illustrations of this law from the marvellous fossil
  wealth of Pikermi and the vast uninterrupted series of tertiary rocks in
  the territories of North America.</p>

  <p>&nbsp;</p>

  <p>I will now sum up the results of this sketch of the rise and progress
  of palæontology. The whole fabric of palæontology is based upon two
  propositions: the first is, that fossils are the remains of animals and
  plants; and the second is, that the stratified rocks in which they are
  found are sedimentary deposits; and each of these propositions is founded
  upon the same axiom, that like effects imply like causes. If there is any
  cause competent to produce a fossil stem, or shell, or bone, except a
  living being, then palæontology has no foundation; if the stratification
  of the rocks is not the effect of such causes as at present produce <!--
  Page 72 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page72"></a>{72}</span>stratification, we have no means of judging
  of the duration of past time, or of the order in which the forms of life
  have succeeded one another. But if these two propositions are granted,
  there is no escape, as it appears to me, from three very important
  conclusions. The first is that living matter has existed upon the earth
  for a vast length of time, certainly for millions of years. The second is
  that, during this lapse of time, the forms of living matter have
  undergone repeated changes, the effect of which has been that the animal
  and vegetable population, at any period of the earth's history, contains
  some species which did not exist at some antecedent period, and others
  which ceased to exist at some subsequent period. The third is that, in
  the case of many groups of mammals and some of reptiles, in which one
  type can be followed through a considerable extent of geological time,
  the series of different forms by which the type is represented, at
  successive intervals of this time, is exactly such as it would be, if
  they had been produced by the gradual modification of the earliest forms
  of the series. These are facts of the history of the earth guaranteed by
  as good evidence as any facts in civil history.</p>

  <p>Hitherto I have kept carefully clear of all the hypotheses to which
  men have at various times endeavoured to fit the facts of palæontology,
  or by which they have endeavoured to connect as many of these facts as
  they happened to be acquainted with. I do not think it would be a
  profitable employment of our time to discuss conceptions which doubtless
  have had their justification and even their use, but which <!-- Page 73
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page73"></a>{73}</span>are now
  obviously incompatible with the well-ascertained truths of palæontology.
  At present these truths leave room for only two hypotheses. The first is
  that, in the course of the history of the earth, innumerable species of
  animals and plants have come into existence, independently of one
  another, innumerable times. This, of course, implies either that
  spontaneous generation on the most astounding scale, and of animals such
  as horses and elephants, has been going on, as a natural process, through
  all the time recorded by the fossiliferous rocks; or it necessitates the
  belief in innumerable acts of creation repeated innumerable times. The
  other hypothesis is, that the successive species of animals and plants
  have arisen, the later by the gradual modification of the earlier. This
  is the hypothesis of evolution; and the palæontological discoveries of
  the last decade are so completely in accordance with the requirements of
  this hypothesis that, if it had not existed, the palæontologist would
  have had to invent it.</p>

  <p>I have always had a certain horror of presuming to set a limit upon
  the possibilities of things. Therefore I will not venture to say that it
  is impossible that the multitudinous species of animals and plants may
  have been produced, one separately from the other, by spontaneous
  generation; nor that it is impossible that they should have been
  independently originated by an endless succession of miraculous creative
  acts. But I must confess that both these hypotheses strike me as so
  astoundingly improbable, so devoid of a shred of either scientific or
  traditional support, that even if <!-- Page 74 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page74"></a>{74}</span>there were no other
  evidence than that of palæontology in its favour, I should feel compelled
  to adopt the hypothesis of evolution. Happily, the future of palæontology
  is independent of all hypothetical considerations. Fifty years hence,
  whoever undertakes to record the progress of palæontology will note the
  present time as the epoch in which the law of succession of the forms of
  the higher animals was determined by the observation of palæontological
  facts. He will point out that, just as Steno and as Cuvier were enabled
  from their knowledge of the empirical laws of coexistence of the parts of
  animals to conclude from a part to the whole, so the knowledge of the law
  of succession of forms empowered their successors to conclude, from one
  or two terms of such a succession, to the whole series; and thus to
  divine the existence of forms of life, of which, perhaps, no trace
  remains, at epochs of inconceivable remoteness in the past.</p>

<h3>II</h3>

<h3>THE INTERPRETERS OF GENESIS AND THE
INTERPRETERS OF NATURE</h3>

  <p>Our fabulist warns "those who in quarrels interpose" of the fate which
  is probably in store for them; and, in venturing to place myself between
  so powerful a controversialist as Mr. Gladstone and the eminent divine
  whom he assaults with such vigour in the last number of this Review,<a
  name="NtA11" href="#Nt11"><sup>[11]</sup></a> I am fully aware that I run
  great danger of verifying Gay's prediction. Moreover, it is quite
  possible that my zeal in offering aid to a combatant so extremely well
  able to take care of himself as M. Réville may be thought to savour of
  indiscretion.</p>

  <p>Two considerations, however, have led me to face the double risk. The
  one is that though, in my judgment, M. Réville is wholly in the right in
  that part of the controversy to which I propose to restrict my
  observations, nevertheless he, as a foreigner, has very little chance of
  making the truth prevail with Englishmen against the authority and the
  dialectic skill of the greatest master of persuasive rhetoric among
  English-speaking men of our time. <!-- Page 76 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page76"></a>{76}</span>As the Queen's proctor
  intervenes, in certain cases, between two litigants in the interests of
  justice, so it may be permitted me to interpose as a sort of
  uncommissioned science proctor. My second excuse for my meddlesomeness
  is, that important questions of natural science&mdash;respecting which
  neither of the combatants professes to speak as an expert&mdash;are
  involved in the controversy; and I think it is desirable that the public
  should know what it is that natural science really has to say on these
  topics, to the best belief of one who has been a diligent student of
  natural science for the last forty years.</p>

  <p>The original <i>Prolégomènes de l'histoire des Religions</i> has not
  come in my way; but I have read the translation of M. Réville's work,
  published in England under the auspices of Professor Max Müller, with
  very great interest. It puts more fairly and clearly than any book
  previously known to me, the view which a man of strong religious
  feelings, but at the same time possessing the information and the
  reasoning power which enable him to estimate the strength of scientific
  methods of inquiry and the weight of scientific truth, may be expected to
  take of the relation between science and religion.</p>

  <p>In the chapter on "The Primitive Revelation" the scientific worth of
  the account of the Creation given in the book of Genesis is estimated in
  terms which are as unquestionably respectful as, in my judgment, they are
  just; and, at the end of the chapter on "Primitive Tradition," M. Réville
  appraises the value of pentateuchal anthropology in a way which I should
  <!-- Page 77 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page77"></a>{77}</span>have thought sure of enlisting the assent of
  all competent judges, even if it were extended to the whole of the
  cosmogony and biology of Genesis:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>As, however, the original traditions of nations sprang up in an epoch
  less remote than our own from the primitive life, it is indispensable to
  consult them, to compare them, and to associate them with other sources
  of information which are available. From this point of view, the
  traditions recorded in Genesis possess, in addition to their own peculiar
  charm, a value of the highest order; but we cannot ultimately see in them
  more than a venerable fragment, well deserving attention, of the great
  genesis of mankind.</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>Mr. Gladstone is of a different mind. He dissents from M. Réville's
  views respecting the proper estimation of the pentateuchal traditions, no
  less than he does from his interpretation of those Homeric myths which
  have been the object of his own special study. In the latter case, Mr.
  Gladstone tells M. Réville that he is wrong on his own authority, to
  which, in such a matter, all will pay due respect: in the former, he
  affirms himself to be "wholly destitute of that kind of knowledge which
  carries authority," and his rebuke is administered in the name and by the
  authority of natural science.</p>

  <p>An air of magisterial gravity hangs about the following
  passage:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>But the question is not here of a lofty poem, or a skilfully
  constructed narrative: it is whether natural science, in the patient
  exercise of its high calling to examine facts, finds that the works of
  God cry out against what we have fondly believed to be His word and tell
  another tale; or whether, in this nineteenth century of Christian
  progress, it substantially echoes back the majestic sound, which, before
  it existed as a pursuit, went forth into all lands. <!-- Page 78 --><span

  <p>First, looking largely at the latter portion of the narrative, which
  describes the creation of living organisms, and waiving details, on some
  of which (as in v. 24) the Septuagint seems to vary from the Hebrew,
  there is a grand fourfold division, set forth in an orderly succession of
  times as follows: on the fifth day</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p>1. The water-population;</p>
      <p>2. The air-population;</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>and, on the sixth day,</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p>3. The land-population of animals;</p>
      <p>4. The land-population consummated in man.</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>Now this same fourfold order is understood to have been so affirmed in
  our time by natural science, that it may be taken as a demonstrated
  conclusion and established fact (p. 696).</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>"Understood?" By whom? I <span class="correction" title="Original reads 'cannnot'."
  >cannot</span> bring myself to imagine that Mr. Gladstone has made so
  solemn and authoritative a statement on a matter of this importance
  without due inquiry&mdash;without being able to found himself upon
  recognised scientific authority. But I wish he had thought fit to name
  the source from whence he has derived his information, as, in that case,
  I could have dealt with his authority, and I should have thereby escaped
  the appearance of making an attack on Mr. Gladstone himself, which is in
  every way distasteful to me.</p>

  <p>For I can meet the statement in the last paragraph of the above
  citation with nothing but a direct negative. If I know anything at all
  about the results attained by the natural science of our time, it is "a
  demonstrated conclusion and established fact" that the "fourfold order"
  given by Mr. Gladstone is not that in which the evidence at our disposal
  <!-- Page 79 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page79"></a>{79}</span>tends to show that the water, air, and
  land-populations of the globe have made their appearance.</p>

  <p>Perhaps I may be told that Mr. Gladstone does give his
  authority&mdash;that he cites Cuvier, Sir John Herschel, and Dr. Whewell
  in support of his case. If that has been Mr. Gladstone's intention in
  mentioning these eminent names, I may remark that, on this particular
  question, the only relevant authority is that of Cuvier. But great as
  Cuvier was, it is to be remembered that, as Mr. Gladstone incidentally
  remarks, he cannot now be called a recent authority. In fact, he has been
  dead more than half a century; and the palæontology of our day is related
  to that of his, very much as the geography of the sixteenth century is
  related to that of the fourteenth. Since 1832, when Cuvier died, not only
  a new world, but new worlds, of ancient life have been discovered; and
  those who have most faithfully carried on the work of the chief founder
  of palæontology have done most to invalidate the essentially negative
  grounds of his speculative adherence to tradition.</p>

  <p>If Mr. Gladstone's latest information on these matters is derived from
  the famous discourse prefixed to the <i>Ossemens Fossiles</i>, I can
  understand the position he has taken up; if he has ever opened a
  respectable modern manual of palæontology, or geology, I cannot. For the
  facts which demolish his whole argument are of the commonest notoriety.
  But before proceeding to consider the evidence for this assertion we must
  be clear about the meaning of the phraseology employed. <!-- Page 80
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page80"></a>{80}</span></p>

  <p>I apprehend that when Mr. Gladstone uses the term "water-population"
  he means those animals which in Genesis i. 21 (Revised Version) are
  spoken of as "the great sea monsters and every living creature that
  moveth, which the waters brought forth abundantly, after their kind." And
  I presume that it will be agreed that whales and porpoises, sea fishes,
  and the innumerable hosts of marine invertebrated animals, are meant
  thereby. So "air-population" must be the equivalent of "fowl" in verse
  20, and "every winged fowl after its kind," verse 21. I suppose I may
  take it for granted that by "fowl" we have here to understand
  birds&mdash;at any rate primarily. Secondarily, it may be that the bats
  and the extinct pterodactyles, which were flying reptiles, come under the
  same head. But whether all insects are "creeping things" of the
  land-population, or whether flying insects are to be included under the
  denomination of "winged fowl," is a point for the decision of Hebrew
  exegetes. Lastly, I suppose I may assume that "land-population" signifies
  "the cattle" and "the beast of the earth," and "every creeping thing that
  creepeth upon the earth," in verses 25 and 26; presumably, it comprehends
  all kinds of terrestrial animals, vertebrate and invertebrate, except
  such as may be comprised under the head of the "air-population."</p>

  <p>Now what I want to make clear is this: that if the terms
  "water-population," "air-population," and "land-population" are
  understood in the senses here defined, natural science has nothing to say
  in favour of the proposition that they succeeded one another in <!-- Page
  81 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page81"></a>{81}</span>the order
  given by Mr. Gladstone; but that, on the contrary, all the evidence we
  possess goes to prove that they did not. Whence it will follow that, if
  Mr. Gladstone has interpreted Genesis rightly (on which point I am most
  anxious to be understood to offer no opinion), that interpretation is
  wholly irreconcilable with the conclusions at present accepted by the
  interpreters of nature&mdash;with everything that can be called "a
  demonstrated conclusion and established fact" of natural science. And be
  it observed that I am not here dealing with a question of speculation,
  but with a question of fact.</p>

  <p>Either the geological record is sufficiently complete to afford us a
  means of determining the order in which animals have made their
  appearance on the globe or it is not. If it is, the determination of that
  order is little more than a mere matter of observation; if it is not,
  then natural science neither affirms nor refutes the "fourfold order,"
  but is simply silent.</p>

  <p>The series of the fossiliferous deposits, which contain the remains of
  the animals which have lived on the earth in past ages of its history,
  and which can alone afford the evidence required by natural science of
  the order of appearance of their different species, may be grouped in the
  manner shown in the left-hand column of the following table, the oldest
  being at the bottom:&mdash;</p>

</table>

  <p>In the right-hand column I have noted the group of strata in which,
  according to our present information, the <i>land</i>, <i>air</i>, and
  <i>water</i>-populations respectively appear for the first time; and in
  consequence of the ambiguity about the meaning of "fowl," I have
  separately indicated the first appearance of bats, birds, flying
  reptiles, and flying insects. It will be observed that, if "fowl" means
  only "bird," or at most flying vertebrate, then the first certain
  evidence of the latter, in the Jurassic epoch, is posterior to the first
  appearance of truly terrestrial <i>Amphibia</i>, and possibly of true
  reptiles, in the Carboniferous epoch (Middle Palæozoic) by a prodigious
  interval of time.</p>

  <p>The water-population of vertebrated animals first appears in the Upper
  Silurian.<a name="NtA12" href="#Nt12"><sup>[12]</sup></a> Therefore, if
  we found ourselves on vertebrated animals and take "fowl" to mean birds
  only, or, at most, flying vertebrates, natural science says that the
  order of succession was water, land, and air-population, and <!-- Page 83
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page83"></a>{83}</span>not&mdash;as Mr.
  Gladstone, founding himself on Genesis, says&mdash;water, air,
  land-population. If a chronicler of Greece affirmed that the age of
  Alexander preceded that of Pericles and immediately succeeded that of the
  Trojan war, Mr. Gladstone would hardly say that this order is "understood
  to have been so affirmed by historical science that it may be taken as a
  demonstrated conclusion and established fact." Yet natural science
  "affirms" his "fourfold order" to exactly the same extent&mdash;neither
  more nor less.</p>

  <p>Suppose, however, that "fowl" is to be taken to include flying
  insects. In that case, the first appearance of an air-population must be
  shifted back for long ages, recent discovery having shown that they occur
  in rocks of Silurian age. Hence there might still have been hope for the
  fourfold order, were it not that the fates unkindly determined that
  scorpions&mdash;"creeping things that creep on the earth" <i>par
  excellence</i>&mdash;turned up in Silurian strata nearly at the same
  time. So that, if the word in the original Hebrew translated "fowl"
  should really after all mean "cockroach"&mdash;and I have great faith in
  the elasticity of that tongue in the hands of Biblical exegetes&mdash;the
  order primarily suggested by the existing evidence&mdash;</p>

  and in direct contradiction of the evidence at present at our disposal.<a

  <p>If, stepping beyond that which may be learned from the facts of the
  successive appearance of the forms of animal life upon the surface of the
  globe, in so far as they are yet made known to us by natural science, we
  apply our reasoning faculties to the task of finding out what those
  observed facts mean, the present conclusions of the interpreters of
  nature appear to be no less directly in conflict with those of the latest
  interpreter of Genesis.</p>

  <p>Mr. Gladstone appears to admit that there is some truth in the
  doctrine of evolution, and indeed places it under very high
  patronage.</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>I contend that evolution in its highest form has not been a <!-- Page
  85 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page85"></a>{85}</span>thing
  heretofore unknown to history, to philosophy, or to theology. I contend
  that it was before the mind of Saint Paul when he taught that in the
  fulness of time God sent forth His Son, and of Eusebius when he wrote the
  <i>Preparation for the Gospel</i>, and of Augustine when he composed the
  <i>City of God</i> (p. 706).</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>Has any one ever disputed the contention, thus solemnly enunciated,
  that the doctrine of evolution was not invented the day before yesterday?
  Has any one ever dreamed of claiming it as a modern innovation? Is there
  any one so ignorant of the history of philosophy as to be unaware that it
  is one of the forms in which speculation embodied itself long before the
  time either of the Bishop of Hippo or of the Apostle to the Gentiles? Is
  Mr. Gladstone, of all people in the world, disposed to ignore the
  founders of Greek philosophy, to say nothing of Indian sages to whom
  evolution was a familiar notion ages before Paul of Tarsus was born? But
  it is ungrateful to cavil at even the most oblique admission of the
  possible value of one of those affirmations of natural science which
  really may be said to be "a demonstrated conclusion and established
  fact." I note it with pleasure, if only for the purpose of introducing
  the observation that, if there is any truth whatever in the doctrine of
  evolution as applied to animals, Mr. Gladstone's gloss on Genesis in the
  following passage is hardly happy:&mdash;</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p>God created</p>
      <p>(<i>a</i>) The water-population;</p>

  <p>6. Pursuing this regular progression from the lower to the higher,
  from the simple to the complex, the text now gives us the work of the
  sixth "day," which supplies the land-population, air and water having
  been already supplied (pp. 695, 696).</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>The gloss to which I refer is the assumption that the "air-population"
  forms a term in the order of progression from lower to higher, from
  simple to complex&mdash;the place of which lies between the
  water-population below and the land-population above&mdash;and I speak of
  it as a "gloss," because the pentateuchal writer is nowise responsible
  for it.</p>

  <p>But it is not true that the air-population, as a whole, is "lower" or
  less "complex" than the land-population. On the contrary, every beginner
  in the study of animal morphology is aware that the organisation of a
  bat, of a bird, or of a pterodactyle presupposes that of a terrestrial
  quadruped; and that it is intelligible only as an extreme modification of
  the organisation of a terrestrial mammal or reptile. In the same way
  winged insects (if they are to be counted among the "air-population")
  presuppose insects which were wingless, and, therefore, as "creeping
  things," were part of the land-population. Thus theory is as much opposed
  as observation to the admission that natural science endorses the
  succession of animal life which Mr. Gladstone finds in Genesis. On the
  contrary, a good many representatives of natural science would be
  prepared to say, on theoretical grounds alone, that it is incredible that
  the "air-population" should have appeared before the
  "land-population"&mdash;and that, if this assertion is to be <!-- Page 87
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page87"></a>{87}</span>found in
  Genesis, it merely demonstrates the scientific worthlessness of the story
  of which it forms a part.</p>

  <p>Indeed, we may go further. It is not even admissible to say that the
  water-population, as a whole, appeared before the air and the
  land-populations. According to the Authorised Version, Genesis especially
  mentions, among the animals created on the fifth day, "great whales," in
  place of which the Revised Version reads "great sea monsters." Far be it
  from me to give an opinion which rendering is right, or whether either is
  right. All I desire to remark is, that if whales and porpoises, dugongs
  and manatees, are to be regarded as members of the water-population (and
  if they are not, what animals can claim the designation?), then that much
  of the water-population has, as certainly, originated later than the
  land-population as bats and birds have. For I am not aware that any
  competent judge would hesitate to admit that the organisation of these
  animals shows the most obvious signs of their descent from terrestrial
  quadrupeds.</p>

  <p>A similar criticism applies to Mr. Gladstone's assumption that, as the
  fourth act of that "orderly succession of times" enunciated in Genesis,
  "the land-population consummated in man."</p>

  <p>If this means simply that man is the final term in the evolutional
  series of which he forms a part, I do not suppose that any objection will
  be raised to that statement on the part of students of natural science.
  But if the pentateuchal author goes further than this, and intends to say
  that which is ascribed to him by <!-- Page 88 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page88"></a>{88}</span>Mr. Gladstone, I think natural science will
  have to enter a <i>caveat</i>. It is by not any means certain that
  man&mdash;I mean the species <i>Homo sapiens</i> of zoological
  terminology&mdash;has "consummated" the land-population in the sense of
  appearing at a later period of time than any other. Let me make my
  meaning clear by an example. From a morphological point of view, our
  beautiful and useful contemporary&mdash;I might almost call him
  colleague&mdash;the horse (<i>Equus caballus</i>), is the last term of
  the evolutional series to which he belongs, just as <i>Homo sapiens</i>
  is the last term of the series of which he is a member. If I want to know
  whether the species <i>Equus caballus</i> made its appearance on the
  surface of the globe before or after <i>Homo sapiens</i>, deduction from
  known laws does not help me. There is no reason, that I know of, why one
  should have appeared sooner or later than the other. If I turn to
  observation, I find abundant remains of <i>Equus caballus</i> in
  Quaternary strata, perhaps a little earlier. The existence of <i>Homo
  sapiens</i> in the Quaternary epoch is also certain. Evidence has been
  adduced in favour of man's existence in the Pliocene, or even in the
  Miocene epoch. It does not satisfy me; but I have no reason to doubt that
  the fact may be so, nevertheless. Indeed, I think it is quite possible
  that further research will show that <i>Homo sapiens</i> existed, not
  only before <i>Equus caballus</i>, but before many other of the existing
  forms of animal life; so that, if all the species of animals have been
  separately created, man, in this case, would by no means be the
  "consummation" of the land-population. <!-- Page 89 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page89"></a>{89}</span></p>

  <p>I am raising no objection to the position of the fourth term in Mr.
  Gladstone's "order"&mdash;on the facts, as they stand, it is quite open
  to any one to hold, as a pious opinion, that the fabrication of man was
  the acme and final achievement of the process of peopling the globe. But
  it must not be said that natural science counts this opinion among her
  "demonstrated conclusions and established facts," for there would be just
  as much, or as little, reason for ranging the contrary opinion among
  them.</p>

  <p>It may seem superfluous to add to the evidence that Mr. Gladstone has
  been utterly misled in supposing that his interpretation of Genesis
  receives any support from natural science. But it is as well to do one's
  work thoroughly while one is about it; and I think it may be advisable to
  point out that the facts, as they are at present known, not only refute
  Mr. Gladstone's interpretation of Genesis in detail, but are opposed to
  the central idea on which it appears to be based.</p>

  <p>There must be some position from which the reconcilers of science and
  Genesis will not retreat, some central idea the maintenance of which is
  vital and its refutation fatal. Even if they now allow that the words
  "the evening and the morning" have not the least reference to a natural
  day, but mean a period of any number of millions of years that may be
  necessary; even if they are driven to admit that the word "creation,"
  which so many millions of pious Jews and Christians have held, and still
  hold, to mean a sudden act of the Deity, signifies a process of gradual
  <!-- Page 90 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page90"></a>{90}</span>evolution of one species from another,
  extending through immeasurable time; even if they are willing to grant
  that the asserted coincidence of the order of Nature with the "fourfold
  order" ascribed to Genesis is an obvious error instead of an established
  truth; they are surely prepared to make a last stand upon the conception
  which underlies the whole, and which constitutes the essence of Mr.
  Gladstone's "fourfold division, set forth in an orderly succession of
  times." It is, that the animal species which compose the
  water-population, the air-population, and the land-population
  respectively, originated during three distinct and successive periods of
  time, and only during those periods of time.</p>

  <p>This statement appears to me to be the interpretation of Genesis which
  Mr. Gladstone supports, reduced to its simplest expression. "Period of
  time" is substituted for "day"; "originated" is substituted for
  "created"; and "any order required" for that adopted by Mr. Gladstone. It
  is necessary to make this proviso, for if "day" may mean a few million
  years, and "creation" may mean evolution, then it is obvious that the
  order (1) water-population, (2) air-population, (3) land-population, may
  also mean (1) water-population, (2) land-population, (3) air-population;
  and it would be unkind to bind down the reconcilers to this detail when
  one has parted with so many others to oblige them.</p>

  <p>But even this sublimated essence of the pentateuchal doctrine (if it
  be such) remains as discordant with natural science as ever. <!-- Page 91
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page91"></a>{91}</span></p>

  <p>It is not true that the species composing any one of the three
  populations originated during any one of three successive periods of
  time, and not at any other of these.</p>

  <p>Undoubtedly, it is in the highest degree probable that animal life
  appeared first under aquatic conditions; that terrestrial forms appeared
  later, and flying animals only after land animals; but it is, at the same
  time, testified by all the evidence we possess, that the great majority,
  if not the whole, of the primordial species of each division have long
  since died out and have been replaced by a vast succession of new forms.
  Hundreds of thousands of animal species, as distinct as those which now
  compose our water, land, and air-populations, have come into existence
  and died out again, throughout the æons of geological time which separate
  us from the lower Palæozoic epoch, when, as I have pointed out, our
  present evidence of the existence of such distinct populations commences.
  If the species of animals have all been separately created, then it
  follows that hundreds of thousands of acts of creative energy have
  occurred, at intervals, throughout the whole time recorded by the
  fossiliferous rocks; and, during the greater part of that time, the
  "creation" of the members of the water, land, and air-populations must
  have gone on contemporaneously.</p>

  <p>If we represent the water, land, and air-populations by <i>a</i>,
  <i>b</i>, and <i>c</i> respectively, and take vertical succession on the
  page to indicate order in time, then the following schemes will roughly
  shadow forth the contrast I have been endeavouring to explain:&mdash;
  <!-- Page 92 --><span class="pagenum"><a

  <p>So far as I can see, there is only one resource left for those modern
  representatives of Sisyphus, the reconcilers of Genesis with science; and
  it has the advantage of being founded on a perfectly legitimate appeal to
  our ignorance. It has been seen that, on any interpretation of the terms
  water-population and land-population, it must be admitted that
  invertebrate representatives of these populations existed during the
  lower Palæozoic epoch. No evolutionist can hesitate to admit that other
  land animals (and possibly vertebrates among them) may have existed
  during that time, of the history of which we know so little; and,
  further, that scorpions are animals of such high organisation that it is
  highly probable their existence indicates that of a long antecedent
  land-population of a similar character.</p>

  <p>Then, since the land-population is said not to have been created until
  the sixth day, it necessarily follows that the evidence of the order in
  which animals appeared must be sought in the record of those older
  Palæozoic times in which only traces of the water-population have as yet
  been discovered.</p>

  <p>Therefore, if any one chooses to say that the creative work took place
  in the Cambrian or Laurentian epoch, in exactly that manner which Mr.
  Gladstone does, and natural science does not, affirm, natural <!-- Page
  93 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page93"></a>{93}</span>science is
  not in a position to disprove the accuracy of the statement. Only one
  cannot have one's cake and eat it too, and such safety from the
  contradiction of science means the forfeiture of her support.</p>

  <p>Whether the account of the work of the first, second, and third days
  in Genesis would be confirmed by the demonstration of the truth of the
  nebular hypothesis; whether it is corroborated by what is known of the
  nature and probable relative antiquity of the heavenly bodies; whether,
  if the Hebrew word translated "firmament" in the Authorised Version
  really means "expanse," the assertion that the waters are partly under
  this "expanse" and partly above it would be any more confirmed by the
  ascertained facts of physical geography and meteorology than it was
  before; whether the creation of the whole vegetable world, and especially
  of "grass, herb yielding seed after its kind, and tree bearing fruit,"
  before any kind of animal, is "affirmed" by the apparently plain teaching
  of botanical palæontology, that grasses and fruit-trees originated long
  subsequently to animals&mdash;all these are questions which, if I mistake
  not, would be answered decisively in the negative by those who are
  specially conversant with the sciences involved. And it must be
  recollected that the issue raised by Mr. Gladstone is not whether, by
  some effort of ingenuity, the pentateuchal story can be shown to be not
  disprovable by scientific knowledge, but whether it is supported
  thereby.</p>

  <p>The form into which Mr. Gladstone has thought fit to throw this
  opinion leaves me in doubt as to its substance. I do not understand how a
  hostile criticism can, under any circumstances, tend to confirm that
  which it attacks. If, however, Mr. Gladstone merely means to express his
  personal impression, "as one wholly destitute of that kind of knowledge
  which carries authority," that he has destroyed the value of these
  criticisms, I have neither the wish nor the right to attempt to disturb
  his faith. On the other hand, I may be permitted to state my own
  conviction that, so far as natural science is involved, M. Réville's
  observations retain the exact value they possessed before Mr. Gladstone
  attacked them.</p>

  <p>&nbsp;</p>

  <p>Trusting that I have now said enough to secure the author of a wise
  and moderate disquisition upon a topic which seems fated to stir unwisdom
  and fanaticism to their depths, a fuller measure of justice than has
  hitherto been accorded to him, I retire from my self-appointed
  championship, with the hope that I shall not hereafter be called upon by
  M. Réville to apologise for damage done to his strong case by imperfect
  or impulsive advocacy. But, perhaps, I may be permitted to add a word or
  two, on my own account, in reference to the great question of the
  relations between science and religion; since it is one about which I
  have thought a good deal ever since I have been able to think at all; and
  about which I have <!-- Page 95 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page95"></a>{95}</span>ventured to express my views publicly, more
  than once, in the course of the last thirty years.</p>

  <p>The antagonism between science and religion, about which we hear so
  much, appears to me to be purely factitious&mdash;fabricated, on the one
  hand, by short-sighted religious people who confound a certain branch of
  science, theology, with religion; and, on the other, by equally
  short-sighted scientific people who forget that science takes for its
  province only that which is susceptible of clear intellectual
  comprehension; and that, outside the boundaries of that province, they
  must be content with imagination, with hope, and with ignorance.</p>

  <p>It seems to me that the moral and intellectual life of the civilised
  nations of Europe is the product of that interaction, sometimes in the
  way of antagonism, sometimes in that of profitable interchange, of the
  Semitic and the Aryan races, which commenced with the dawn of history,
  when Greek and Ph&oelig;nician came in contact, and has been continued by
  Carthaginian and Roman, by Jew and Gentile, down to the present day. Our
  art (except, perhaps, music) and our science are the contributions of the
  Aryan; but the essence of our religion is derived from the Semite. In the
  eighth century <span class="scac">B.C.</span>, in the heart of a world of
  idolatrous polytheists, the Hebrew prophets put forth a conception of
  religion which appears to me to be as wonderful an inspiration of genius
  as the art of Pheidias or the science of Aristotle.</p>

  <p>"And what doth the Lord require of thee, but to <!-- Page 96 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page96"></a>{96}</span>do justly, and to love
  mercy, and to walk humbly with thy God?"</p>

  <p>If any so-called religion takes away from this great saying of Micah,
  I think it wantonly mutilates, while, if it adds thereto, I think it
  obscures, the perfect ideal of religion.</p>

  <p>But what extent of knowledge, what acuteness of scientific criticism,
  can touch this, if any one possessed of knowledge, or acuteness, could be
  absurd enough to make the attempt? Will the progress of research prove
  that justice is worthless and mercy hateful; will it ever soften the
  bitter contrast between our actions and our aspirations; or show us the
  bounds of the universe, and bid us say, Go to, now we comprehend the
  infinite? A faculty of wrath lay in those ancient Israelites, and surely
  the prophet's staff would have made swift acquaintance with the head of
  the scholar who had asked Micah whether, peradventure, the Lord further
  required of him an implicit belief in the accuracy of the cosmogony of
  Genesis!</p>

  <p>What we are usually pleased to call religion nowadays is, for the most
  part, Hellenised Judaism; and, not unfrequently, the Hellenic element
  carries with it a mighty remnant of old-world paganism and a great
  infusion of the worst and weakest products of Greek scientific
  speculation; while fragments of Persian and Babylonian, or rather
  Accadian, mythology burden the Judaic contribution to the common
  stock.</p>

  <p>The antagonism of science is not to religion, but to the heathen
  survivals and the bad philosophy under which religion herself is often
  wellnigh crushed. <!-- Page 97 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page97"></a>{97}</span>And, for my part, I trust that this
  antagonism will never cease; but that, to the end of time, true science
  will continue to fulfil one of her most beneficent functions, that of
  relieving men from the burden of false science which is imposed upon them
  in the name of religion.</p>

  <p>This is the work that M. Réville and men such as he are doing for us;
  this is the work which his opponents are endeavouring, consciously or
  unconsciously, to hinder.</p>

<h3>III</h3>

<h3>MR. GLADSTONE AND GENESIS</h3>

  <p>In controversy, as in courtship, the good old rule to be off with the
  old before one is on with the new, greatly commends itself to my sense of
  expediency. And, therefore, it appears to me desirable that I should
  preface such observations as I may have to offer upon the cloud of
  arguments (the relevancy of which to the issue which I had ventured to
  raise is not always obvious) put forth by Mr. Gladstone in the January
  number of this Review,<a name="NtA14" href="#Nt14"><sup>[14]</sup></a> by
  an endeavour to make clear to such of our readers as have not had the
  advantage of a forensic education the present net result of the
  discussion.</p>

  <p>I am quite aware that, in undertaking this task, I run all the risks
  to which the man who presumes to deal judicially with his own cause is
  liable. But it is exactly because I do not shun that risk, but, rather,
  earnestly desire to be judged by him who cometh after me, provided that
  he has the knowledge and impartiality appropriate to a judge, that I
  adopt my present course.</p>

<p><!-- Page 99 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page99"></a>{99}</span></p>

  <p>In the article on "The Dawn of Creation and Worship," it will be
  remembered that Mr. Gladstone unreservedly commits himself to three
  propositions. The first is that, according to the writer of the
  Pentateuch, the "water-population," the "air-population," and the
  "land-population" of the globe were created successively, in the order
  named. In the second place, Mr. Gladstone authoritatively asserts that
  this (as part of his "fourfold order") has been "so affirmed in our time
  by natural science, that it may be taken as a demonstrated conclusion and
  established fact." In the third place, Mr. Gladstone argues that the fact
  of this coincidence of the pentateuchal story with the results of modern
  investigation makes it "impossible to avoid the conclusion, first, that
  either this writer was gifted with faculties passing all human
  experience, or else his knowledge was divine." And having settled to his
  own satisfaction that the first "branch of the alternative is truly
  nominal and unreal," Mr. Gladstone continues, "So stands the plea for a
  revelation of truth from God, a plea only to be met by questioning its
  possibility" (p. 697).</p>

  <p>I am a simple-minded person, wholly devoid of subtlety of intellect,
  so that I willingly admit that there may be depths of alternative meaning
  in these propositions out of all soundings attainable by my poor plummet.
  Still there are a good many people who suffer under a like intellectual
  limitation; and, for once in my life, I feel that I have the chance of
  attaining that position of a representative of average opinion which
  appears to be the modern ideal of a <!-- Page 100 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page100"></a>{100}</span>leader of men, when I
  make free confession that, after turning the matter over in my mind, with
  all the aid derived from a careful consideration of Mr. Gladstone's
  reply, I cannot get away from my original conviction that, if Mr.
  Gladstone's second proposition can be shown to be not merely inaccurate,
  but directly contradictory of facts known to every one who is acquainted
  with the elements of natural science, the third proposition collapses of
  itself.</p>

  <p>And it was this conviction which led me to enter upon the present
  discussion. I fancied that if my respected clients, the people of average
  opinion and capacity, could once be got distinctly to conceive that Mr.
  Gladstone's views as to the proper method of dealing with grave and
  difficult scientific and religious problems had permitted him to base a
  solemn "plea for a revelation of truth from God" upon an error as to a
  matter of fact, from which the intelligent perusal of a manual of
  palæontology would have saved him, I need not trouble myself to occupy
  their time and attention with further comments upon his contribution to
  apologetic literature. It is for others to judge whether I have
  efficiently carried out my project or not. It certainly does not count
  for much that I should be unable to find any flaw in my own case, but I
  think it counts for a good deal that Mr. Gladstone appears to have been
  equally unable to do so. He does, indeed, make a great parade of
  authorities, and I have the greatest respect for those authorities whom
  Mr. Gladstone mentions. If he will get them to sign a joint memorial to
  the effect that our present <!-- Page 101 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page101"></a>{101}</span>palæontological evidence proves that birds
  appeared before the "land-population" of terrestrial reptiles, I shall
  think it my duty to reconsider my position&mdash;but not till then.</p>

  <p>It will be observed that I have cautiously used the word "appears" in
  referring to what seems to me to be absence of any real answer to my
  criticisms in Mr. Gladstone's reply. For I must honestly confess that,
  notwithstanding long and painful strivings after clear insight, I am
  still uncertain whether Mr. Gladstone's "Defence" means that the great
  "plea for a revelation from God" is to be left to perish in the dialectic
  desert; or whether it is to be withdrawn under the protection of such
  skirmishers as are available for covering retreat.</p>

  <p>In particular, the remarkable disquisition which covers pages 11 to 14
  of Mr. Gladstone's last contribution has greatly exercised my mind.
  Socrates is reported to have said of the works of Heraclitus that he who
  attempted to comprehend them should be a "Delian swimmer," but that, for
  his part, what he could understand was so good that he was disposed to
  believe in the excellence of that which he found unintelligible. In
  endeavouring to make myself master of Mr. Gladstone's meaning in these
  pages, I have often been overcome by a feeling analogous to that of
  Socrates, but not quite the same. That which I do understand, in fact,
  has appeared to me so very much the reverse of good, that I have
  sometimes permitted myself to doubt the value of that which I do not
  understand. <!-- Page 102 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page102"></a>{102}</span></p>

  <p>In this part of Mr. Gladstone's reply, in fact, I find nothing of
  which the bearing upon my arguments is clear to me, except that which
  relates to the question whether reptiles, so far as they are represented
  by tortoises and the great majority of lizards and snakes, which are land
  animals, are creeping things in the sense of the pentateuchal writer or
  not.</p>

  <p>I have every respect for the singer of the Song of the Three Children
  (whoever he may have been); I desire to cast no shadow of doubt upon,
  but, on the contrary, marvel at, the exactness of Mr. Gladstone's
  information as to the considerations which "affected the method of the
  Mosaic writer"; nor do I venture to doubt that the inconvenient intrusion
  of these contemptible reptiles&mdash;"a family fallen from greatness" (p.
  14), a miserable decayed aristocracy reduced to mere "skulkers about the
  earth" (<i>ibid.</i>)&mdash;in consequence, apparently, of difficulties
  about the occupation of land arising out of the earth-hunger of their
  former serfs, the mammals&mdash;into an apologetic argument, which
  otherwise would run quite smoothly, is in every way to be deprecated.
  Still, the wretched creatures stand there, importunately demanding
  notice; and, however different may be the practice in that contentious
  atmosphere with which Mr. Gladstone expresses and laments his
  familiarity, in the atmosphere of science it really is of no avail
  whatever to shut one's eyes to facts, or to try to bury them out of sight
  under a tumulus of rhetoric. That is my experience of "the Elysian
  regions of Science," wherein it is a pleasure to me to think that a man
  of Mr. Gladstone's <!-- Page 103 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page103"></a>{103}</span>intimate knowledge of English life, during
  the last quarter of a century, believes my philosophic existence to have
  been rounded off in unbroken equanimity.</p>

  <p>However reprehensible, and indeed contemptible, terrestrial reptiles
  may be, the only question which appears to me to be relevant to my
  argument is whether these creatures are or are not comprised under the
  denomination of "everything that creepeth upon the ground."</p>

  <p>Mr. Gladstone speaks of the author of the first chapter of Genesis as
  "the Mosaic writer"; I suppose, therefore, that he will admit that it is
  equally proper to speak of the author of Leviticus as the "Mosaic
  writer." Whether such a phrase would be used by any one who had an
  adequate conception of the assured results of modern Biblical criticism
  is another matter; but, at any rate, it cannot be denied that Leviticus
  has as much claim to Mosaic authorship as Genesis. Therefore, if one
  wants to know the sense of a phrase used in Genesis, it will be well to
  see what Leviticus has to say on the matter. Hence, I commend the
  following extract from the eleventh chapter of Leviticus to Mr.
  Gladstone's serious attention:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>And these are they which are unclean unto you among the creeping
  things that creep upon the earth: the weasel, and the mouse, and the
  great lizard after its kind, and the gecko, and the land-crocodile, and
  the sand-lizard, and the chameleon. These are they which are unclean to
  you among all that creep (v. 29-31).</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>The merest Sunday-school exegesis therefore suffices <!-- Page 104
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page104"></a>{104}</span>to prove that
  when the "Mosaic writer" in Genesis i. 24 speaks of "creeping things," he
  means to include lizards among them.</p>

  <p>This being so, it is agreed, on all hands, that terrestrial lizards,
  and other reptiles allied to lizards, occur in the Permian strata. It is
  further agreed that the Triassic strata were deposited after these.
  Moreover, it is well known that, even if certain footprints are to be
  taken as unquestionable evidence of the existence of birds, they are not
  known to occur in rocks earlier than the Trias, while indubitable remains
  of birds are to be met with only much later. Hence it follows that
  natural science does not "affirm" the statement that birds were made on
  the fifth day, and "everything that creepeth on the ground" on the sixth,
  on which Mr. Gladstone rests his order; for, as is shown by Leviticus,
  the "Mosaic writer" includes lizards among his "creeping things."</p>

  <p>Perhaps I have given myself superfluous trouble in the preceding
  argument, for I find that Mr. Gladstone is willing to assume (he does not
  say to admit) that the statement in the text of Genesis as to reptiles
  cannot "in all points be sustained" (p. 16). But my position is that it
  cannot be sustained in any point, so that, after all, it has perhaps been
  as well to go over the evidence again. And then Mr. Gladstone proceeds as
  if nothing had happened to tell us that&mdash;</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>There remain great unshaken facts to be weighed. First, the fact that
  such a record should have been made at all.</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>As most peoples have their cosmogonies, this "fact" does not strike me
  as having much value. <!-- Page 105 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page105"></a>{105}</span></p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>Secondly, the fact that, instead of dwelling in generalities, it has
  placed itself under the severe conditions of a chronological order
  reaching from the first <i>nisus</i> of chaotic matter to the consummated
  production of a fair and goodly, a furnished and a peopled world.</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>This "fact" can be regarded as of value only by ignoring the fact
  demonstrated in my previous paper, that natural science does not confirm
  the order asserted so far as living things are concerned; and by
  upsetting a fact to be brought to light presently, to wit, that, in
  regard to the rest of the pentateuchal cosmogony, prudent science has
  very little to say one way or the other.</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>Thirdly, the fact that its cosmogony seems, in the light of the
  nineteenth century, to draw more and more of countenance from the best
  natural philosophy.</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>I have already questioned the accuracy of this statement, and I do not
  observe that mere repetition adds to its value.</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>And, fourthly, that it has described the successive origins of the
  five great categories of present life with which human experience was and
  is conversant, in that order which geological authority confirms.</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>By comparison with a sentence on page 14, in which a fivefold order is
  substituted for the "fourfold order," on which the "plea for revelation"
  was originally founded, it appears that these five categories are
  "plants, fishes, birds, mammals, and man," which, Mr. Gladstone affirms,
  "are given to us in Genesis in the order of succession in which they are
  also given by the latest geological authorities." <!-- Page 106 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page106"></a>{106}</span></p>

  <p>I must venture to demur to this statement. I showed, in my previous
  paper, that there is no reason to doubt that the term "great sea monster"
  (used in Gen. i. 21) includes the most conspicuous of great sea
  animals&mdash;namely, whales, dolphins, porpoises, manatees, and
  dugongs;<a name="NtA15" href="#Nt15"><sup>[15]</sup></a> and, as these
  are indubitable mammals, it is impossible to affirm that mammals come
  after birds, which are said to have been created on the same day.
  Moreover, I pointed out that as these Cetacea and Sirenia are certainly
  modified land animals, their existence implies the antecedent existence
  of land mammals.</p>

  <p>Furthermore, I have to remark that the term "fishes," as used,
  technically, in zoology, by no means covers all the moving creatures that
  have life, which are bidden to "fill the waters in the seas" (Gen. i.
  20-22). Marine mollusks and crustacea, echinoderms, corals, and
  foraminifera are not technically fishes. But they are abundant in the
  palæozoic rocks, ages upon ages older than those in which the first
  evidences of true fishes appear. And if, in a geological book, Mr.
  Gladstone finds the quite true statement that plants appeared before
  fishes, it is only by a complete misunderstanding that he can be led to
  imagine it serves his purpose. As a matter of fact, at the present
  moment, it is a question whether, on the bare evidence afforded by
  fossils, the marine creeping thing or the marine plant has the seniority.
  <!-- Page 107 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page107"></a>{107}</span>No cautious palæontologist would express a
  decided opinion on the matter. But, if we are to read the pentateuchal
  statement as a scientific document (and, in spite of all protests to the
  contrary, those who bring it into comparison with science do seek to make
  a scientific document of it), then, as it is quite clear that only
  terrestrial plants of high organisation are spoken of in verses 11 and
  12, no palæontologist would hesitate to say that, at present, the records
  of sea animal life are vastly older than those of any land plant
  describable as "grass, herb yielding seed, or fruit-tree."</p>

  <p>Thus, although, in Mr. Gladstone's "Defence," the "old order passeth
  into new," his case is not improved. The fivefold order is no more
  "affirmed in our time by natural science" to be "a demonstrated
  conclusion and established fact" than the fourfold order was. Natural
  science appears to me to decline to have anything to do with either; they
  are as wrong in detail as they are mistaken in principle.</p>

  <p>There is another change of position, the value of which is not so
  apparent to me, as it may well seem to be to those who are unfamiliar
  with the subject under discussion. Mr. Gladstone discards his three
  groups of "water-population," "air-population," and "land-population,"
  and substitutes for them (1) fishes, (2) birds, (3) mammals, (4) man.
  Moreover, it is assumed, in a note, that "the higher or ordinary mammals"
  alone were known to the "Mosaic writer" (p. 6). No doubt it looks, at
  first, as if something <!-- Page 108 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page108"></a>{108}</span>were gained by this alteration; for, as I
  have just pointed out, the word "fishes" can be used in two senses, one
  of which has a deceptive appearance of adjustability to the "Mosaic"
  account. Then the inconvenient reptiles are banished out of sight; and,
  finally, the question of the exact meaning of "higher" and "ordinary" in
  the case of mammals opens up the prospect of a hopeful logomachy. But
  what is the good of it all in the face of Leviticus on the one hand and
  of palæontology on the other?</p>

  <p>As, in my apprehension, there is not a shadow of justification for the
  suggestion that when the pentateuchal writer says "fowl" he excludes bats
  (which, as we shall see directly, are expressly included under "fowl" in
  Leviticus), and as I have already shown that he demonstrably includes
  reptiles, as well as mammals, among the creeping things of the land, I
  may be permitted to spare my readers further discussion of the "fivefold
  order." On the whole, it is seen to be rather more inconsistent with
  Genesis than its fourfold predecessor.</p>

  <p>But I have yet a fresh order to face. Mr. Gladstone (p. 11)
  understands "the main statements of Genesis in successive order of time,
  but without any measurement of its divisions, to be as
  follows:&mdash;</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p>1. A period of land, anterior to all life (v. 9, 10).</p>
      <p>2. A period of vegetable life, anterior to animal life (v. 11, 12).</p>
      <p>3. A period of animal life, in the order of fishes (v. 20).</p>
      <p>4. Another stage of animal life, in the order of birds.</p>
      <p>5. Another, in the order of beasts (v. 24, 25).</p>
      <p>6. Last of all, man (v. 26, 27)."</p>
    </div>
  </div>

<p><!-- Page 109 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page109"></a>{109}</span></p>

  <p>Mr. Gladstone then tries to find the proof of the occurrence of a
  similar succession in sundry excellent works on geology.</p>

  <p>I am really grieved to be obliged to say that this third (or is it
  fourth?) modification of the foundation of the "plea for revelation"
  originally set forth, satisfies me as little as any of its
  predecessors.</p>

  <p>For, in the first place, I cannot accept the assertion that this order
  is to be found in Genesis. With respect to No. 5, for example, I hold, as
  I have already said, that "great sea monsters" includes the Cetacea, in
  which case mammals (which is what, I suppose, Mr. Gladstone means by
  "beasts") come in under head No. 3, and not under No. 5. Again, "fowl"
  are said in Genesis to be created on the same day as fishes; therefore I
  cannot accept an order which makes birds succeed fishes. Once more, as it
  is quite certain that the term "fowl" includes the bats,&mdash;for in
  Leviticus xi. 13-19 we read, "And these shall ye have in abomination
  among the fowls ... the heron after its kind, and the hoopoe, and the
  bat,"&mdash;it is obvious that bats are also said to have been created at
  stage No. 3. And as bats are mammals, and their existence obviously
  presupposes that of terrestrial "beasts," it is quite clear that the
  latter could not have first appeared as No. 5. I need not repeat my
  reasons for doubting whether man came "last of all."</p>

  <p>As the latter half of Mr. Gladstone's sixfold order thus shows itself
  to be wholly unauthorised by, and inconsistent with, the plain language
  of the Pentateuch, <!-- Page 110 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page110"></a>{110}</span>I might decline to discuss the
  admissibility of its former half.</p>

  <p>But I will add one or two remarks on this point also. Does Mr.
  Gladstone mean to say that in any of the works he has cited, or indeed
  anywhere else, he can find scientific warranty for the assertion that
  there was a period of land&mdash;by which I suppose he means dry land
  (for submerged land must needs be as old as the separate existence of the
  sea)&mdash;"anterior to all life"?</p>

  <p>It may be so, or it may not be so; but where is the evidence which
  would justify any one in making a positive assertion on the subject? What
  competent palæontologist will affirm, at this present moment, that he
  knows anything about the period at which life originated, or will assert
  more than the extreme probability that such origin was a long way
  antecedent to any traces of life at present known? What physical
  geologist will affirm that he knows when dry land began to exist, or will
  say more than that it was probably very much earlier than any extant
  direct evidence of terrestrial conditions indicates?</p>

  <p>I think I know pretty well the answers which the authorities quoted by
  Mr. Gladstone would give to these questions; but I leave it to them to
  give them if they think fit.</p>

  <p>If I ventured to speculate on the matter at all, I should say it is by
  no means certain that sea is older than dry land, inasmuch as a solid
  terrestrial surface may very well have existed before the earth was cool
  enough to allow of the existence of fluid water. And, <!-- Page 111
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page111"></a>{111}</span>in this case,
  dry land may have existed before the sea. As to the first appearance of
  life, the whole argument of analogy, whatever it may be worth in such a
  case, is in favour of the absence of living beings until long after the
  hot water seas had constituted themselves; and of the subsequent
  appearance of aquatic before terrestrial forms of life. But whether these
  "protoplasts" would, if we could examine them, be reckoned among the
  lowest microscopic algæ, or fungi; or among those doubtful organisms
  which lie in the debatable land between animals and plants, is, in my
  judgment, a question on which a prudent biologist will reserve his
  opinion.</p>

  <p>&nbsp;</p>

  <p>I think that I have now disposed of those parts of Mr. Gladstone's
  defence in which I seem to discover a design to rescue his solemn "plea
  for revelation." But a great deal of the "Proem to Genesis" remains which
  I would gladly pass over in silence, were such a course consistent with
  the respect due to so distinguished a champion of the "reconcilers."</p>

  <p>I hope that my clients&mdash;the people of average opinions&mdash;have
  by this time some confidence in me; for when I tell them that, after all,
  Mr. Gladstone is of opinion that the "Mosaic record" was meant to give
  moral, and not scientific, instruction to those for whom it was written,
  they may be disposed to think that I must be misleading them. But let
  them listen further to what Mr. Gladstone says in a compendious but not
  exactly correct statement respecting my opinions:&mdash; <!-- Page 112
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page112"></a>{112}</span></p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>He holds the writer responsible for scientific precision: I look for
  nothing of the kind, but assign to him a statement general, which admits
  exceptions; popular, which aims mainly at producing moral impression;
  summary, which cannot but be open to more or less of criticism of detail.
  He thinks it is a lecture. I think it is a sermon (p. 5).</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>I note, incidentally, that Mr. Gladstone appears to consider that the
  <i>differentia</i> between a lecture and a sermon is, that the former, so
  far as it deals with matters of fact, may be taken seriously, as meaning
  exactly what it says, while a sermon may not. I have quite enough on my
  hands without taking up the cudgels for the clergy, who will probably
  find Mr. Gladstone's definition unflattering.</p>

  <p>But I am diverging from my proper business, which is to say that I
  have given no ground for the ascription of these opinions; and that, as a
  matter of fact, I do not hold them and never have held them. It is Mr.
  Gladstone, and not I, who will have it that the pentateuchal cosmogony is
  to be taken as science.</p>

  <p>My belief, on the contrary, is, and long has been, that the
  pentateuchal story of the creation is simply a myth. I suppose it to be
  an hypothesis respecting the origin of the universe which some ancient
  thinker found himself able to reconcile with his knowledge, or what he
  thought was knowledge, of the nature of things, and therefore assumed to
  be true. As such, I hold it to be not merely an interesting, but a
  venerable, monument of a stage in the mental progress of mankind; and I
  find it difficult to suppose that any one who is acquainted with the
  cosmogonies of other <!-- Page 113 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page113"></a>{113}</span>nations&mdash;and especially with those of
  the Egyptians and the Babylonians, with whom the Israelites were in such
  frequent and intimate communication&mdash;should consider it to possess
  either more, or less, scientific importance than may be allotted to
  these.</p>

  <p>Mr. Gladstone's definition of a sermon permits me to suspect that he
  may not see much difference between that form of discourse and what I
  call a myth; and I hope it may be something more than the slowness of
  apprehension, to which I have confessed, which leads me to imagine that a
  statement which is "general" but "admits exceptions," which is "popular"
  and "aims mainly at producing moral impression," "summary" and therefore
  open to "criticism of detail," amounts to a myth, or perhaps less than a
  myth. Put algebraically, it comes to this, <i>x</i> = <i>a</i> + <i>b</i>
  + <i>c</i>; always remembering that there is nothing to show the exact
  value of either <i>a</i>, or <i>b</i>, or <i>c</i>. It is true that
  <i>a</i> is commonly supposed to equal 10, but there are exceptions, and
  these may reduce it to 8, or 3, or 0; <i>b</i> also popularly means 10,
  but being chiefly used by the algebraist as a "moral" value, you cannot
  do much with it in the addition or subtraction of mathematical values;
  <i>c</i> also is quite "summary," and if you go into the details of which
  it is made up, many of them may be wrong, and their sum total equal to 0,
  or even to a minus quantity.</p>

  <p>Mr. Gladstone appears to wish that I should (1) enter upon a sort of
  essay competition with the author of the pentateuchal cosmogony; (2) that
  I should make a further statement about some <!-- Page 114 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page114"></a>{114}</span>elementary facts in the
  history of Indian and Greek philosophy; and (3) that I should show cause
  for my hesitation in accepting the assertion that Genesis is supported,
  at any rate to the extent of the first two verses, by the nebular
  hypothesis.</p>

  <p>A certain sense of humour prevents me from accepting the first
  invitation. I would as soon attempt to put Hamlet's soliloquy into a more
  scientific shape. But if I supposed the "Mosaic writer" to be inspired,
  as Mr. Gladstone does, it would not be consistent with my notions of
  respect for the Supreme Being to imagine Him unable to frame a form of
  words which should accurately, or, at least, not inaccurately, express
  His own meaning. It is sometimes said that, had the statements contained
  in the first chapter of Genesis been scientifically true, they would have
  been unintelligible to ignorant people; but how is the matter mended if,
  being scientifically untrue, they must needs be rejected by instructed
  people?</p>

  <p>With respect to the second suggestion, it would be presumptuous in me
  to pretend to instruct Mr. Gladstone in matters which lie as much within
  the province of Literature and History as in that of Science; but if any
  one desirous of further knowledge will be so good as to turn to that most
  excellent and by no means recondite source of information, the
  <i>Encyclopædia Britannica</i>, he will find, under the letter E, the
  word "Evolution," and a long article on that subject. Now, I do not
  recommend him to read the first half of the article; but the second half,
  by my <!-- Page 115 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page115"></a>{115}</span>friend Mr. Sully, is really very good. He
  will there find it said that in some of the philosophies of ancient
  India, the idea of evolution is clearly expressed: "Brahma is conceived
  as the eternal self-existent being, which, on its material side, unfolds
  itself to the world by gradually condensing itself to material objects
  through the gradations of ether, fire, water, earth, and other elements."
  And again: "In the later system of emanation of Sankhya there is a more
  marked approach to a materialistic doctrine of evolution." What little
  knowledge I have of the matter&mdash;chiefly derived from that very
  instructive book, <i>Die Religion des Buddha</i>, by C.&nbsp;F. Koeppen,
  supplemented by Hardy's interesting works&mdash;leads me to think that
  Mr. Sully might have spoken much more strongly as to the evolutionary
  character of Indian philosophy, and especially of that of the Buddhists.
  But the question is too large to be dealt with incidentally.</p>

  <p>And, with respect to early Greek philosophy,<a name="NtA16"
  href="#Nt16"><sup>[16]</sup></a> the seeker after additional
  enlightenment need go no further than the same excellent storehouse of
  information:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>The early Ionian physicists, including Thales, Anaximander, and
  Anaximenes, seek to explain the world as generated out of a primordial
  matter which is at the same time the universal support of things. This
  substance is endowed with a generative or transmutative force by virtue
  of which it passes into a <!-- Page 116 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page116"></a>{116}</span>succession of forms. They thus resemble
  modern evolutionists, since they regard the world, with its infinite
  variety of forms, as issuing from a simple mode of matter.</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>Further on, Mr. Sully remarks that "Heraclitus deserves a prominent
  place in the history of the idea of evolution," and he states, with
  perfect justice, that Heraclitus has foreshadowed some of the special
  peculiarities of Mr. Darwin's views. It is indeed a very strange
  circumstance that the philosophy of the great Ephesian more than
  adumbrates the two doctrines which have played leading parts, the one in
  the development of Christian dogma, the other in that of natural science.
  The former is the conception of the Word (<span title="logos" class="grk"
  >&lambda;&#x1F79;&gamma;&omicron;&sigmaf;</span>) which took its Jewish
  shape in Alexandria, and its Christian form<a name="NtA17"
  href="#Nt17"><sup>[17]</sup></a> in that Gospel which is usually referred
  to an Ephesian source of some five centuries later date; and the latter
  is that of the struggle for existence. The saying that "strife is father
  and king of all" (<span title="polemos pantôn men patêr esti, panton de basileus" class="grk"
  >&pi;&#x1F79;&lambda;&epsilon;&mu;&omicron;&sigmaf;
  &pi;&#x1F71;&nu;&tau;&omega;&nu; &mu;&#x1F72;&nu;

  &pi;&#x1F71;&nu;&tau;&omicron;&nu; &delta;&#x1F72;
  &beta;&alpha;&sigma;&iota;&lambda;&epsilon;&#x1F7B;&sigmaf;</span>),
  ascribed to Heraclitus, would be a not inappropriate motto for the
  "Origin of Species."</p>

  <p>I have referred only to Mr. Sully's article, because his authority is
  quite sufficient for my purpose. But the consultation of any of the more
  elaborate histories of Greek philosophy, such as the great work of
  Zeller, for example, will only bring out the same fact into still more
  striking prominence. I have professed no "minute acquaintance" with
  either Indian or Greek philosophy, but I have taken a great deal of pains
  to <!-- Page 117 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page117"></a>{117}</span>secure that such knowledge as I do possess
  shall be accurate and trustworthy.</p>

  <p>In the third place, Mr. Gladstone appears to wish that I should
  discuss with him the question whether the nebular hypothesis is, or is
  not, confirmatory of the pentateuchal account of the origin of things.
  Mr. Gladstone appears to be prepared to enter upon this campaign with a
  light heart. I confess I am not, and my reason for this backwardness will
  doubtless surprise Mr. Gladstone. It is that, rather more than a quarter
  of a century ago (namely, in February 1859), when it was my duty, as
  President of the Geological Society, to deliver the Anniversary
  Address,<a name="NtA18" href="#Nt18"><sup>[18]</sup></a> I chose a topic
  which involved a very careful study of the remarkable cosmogonical
  speculation, originally promulgated by Immanuel Kant and, subsequently,
  by Laplace, which is now known as the nebular hypothesis. With the help
  of such little acquaintance with the principles of physics and astronomy
  as I had gained, I endeavoured to obtain a clear understanding of this
  speculation in all its bearings. I am not sure that I succeeded; but of
  this I am certain, that the problems involved are very difficult, even
  for those who possess the intellectual discipline requisite for dealing
  with them. And it was this conviction that led me to express my desire to
  leave the discussion of the question of the asserted harmony between
  Genesis and the nebular hypothesis to experts in the appropriate branches
  of knowledge. And I think my course was a <!-- Page 118 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page118"></a>{118}</span>wise one; but as Mr.
  Gladstone evidently does not understand how there can be any hesitation
  on my part, unless it arises from a conviction that he is in the right, I
  may go so far as to set out my difficulties.</p>

  <p>They are of two kinds&mdash;exegetical and scientific. It appears to
  me that it is vain to discuss a supposed coincidence between Genesis and
  science unless we have first settled, on the one hand, what Genesis says,
  and, on the other hand, what science says.</p>

  <p>In the first place, I cannot find any consensus among Biblical
  scholars as to the meaning of the words, "In the beginning God created
  the heaven and the earth." Some say that the Hebrew word <i>bara</i>,
  which is translated "create," means "made out of nothing." I venture to
  object to that rendering, not on the ground of scholarship, but of common
  sense. Omnipotence itself can surely no more make something "out of"
  nothing than it can make a triangular circle. What is intended by "made
  out of nothing" appears to be "caused to come into existence," with the
  implication that nothing of the same kind previously existed. It is
  further usually assumed that "the heaven and the earth" means the
  material substance of the universe. Hence the "Mosaic writer" is taken to
  imply that where nothing of a material nature previously existed, this
  substance appeared. That is perfectly conceivable, and therefore no one
  can deny that it may have happened. But there are other very
  authoritative <!-- Page 119 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page119"></a>{119}</span>critics who say that the ancient
  Israelite<a name="NtA19" href="#Nt19"><sup>[19]</sup></a> who wrote the
  passage was not likely to have been capable of such abstract thinking;
  and that, as a matter of philology, <i>bara</i> is commonly used to
  signify the "fashioning," or "forming," of that which already exists. Now
  it appears to me that the scientific investigator is wholly incompetent
  to say anything at all about the first origin of the material universe.
  The whole power of his organon vanishes when he has to step beyond the
  chain of natural causes and effects. No form of the nebular hypothesis,
  that I know of, is necessarily connected with any view of the origination
  of the nebular substance. Kant's form of it expressly supposes that the
  nebular material from which one stellar system starts may be nothing but
  the disintegrated substance of a stellar and planetary system which has
  just come to an end. Therefore, so far as I can see, one who believes
  that matter has existed from all eternity has just as much right to hold
  the nebular hypothesis as one who believes that matter came into
  existence at a specified epoch. In other words, the nebular hypothesis
  and the creation hypothesis, up to this point, neither confirm nor oppose
  one another.</p>

  <p>Next, we read in the revisers' version, in which I suppose the
  ultimate results of critical scholarship to be embodied: "And the earth
  was waste ['without form,' in the Authorised Version] and void." Most
  <!-- Page 120 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page120"></a>{120}</span>people seem to think that this phraseology
  intends to imply that the matter out of which the world was to be formed
  was a veritable "chaos," devoid of law and order. If this interpretation
  is correct, the nebular hypothesis can have nothing to say to it. The
  scientific thinker cannot admit the absence of law and order, anywhere or
  anywhen, in nature. Sometimes law and order are patent and visible to our
  limited vision; sometimes they are hidden. But every particle of the
  matter of the most fantastic-looking nebula in the heavens is a realm of
  law and order in itself; and, that it is so, is the essential condition
  of the possibility of solar and planetary evolution from the apparent
  chaos.<a name="NtA20" href="#Nt20"><sup>[20]</sup></a></p>

  <p>"Waste" is too vague a term to be worth consideration. "Without form,"
  intelligible enough as a metaphor, if taken literally, is absurd; for a
  material thing existing in space must have a superficies, and if it has a
  superficies it has a form. The wildest streaks of marestail clouds in the
  sky, or the most irregular heavenly nebulæ, have surely just as much form
  as a geometrical tetrahedron; and as for "void," how can that be void
  which is full of matter? As poetry, these lines are vivid and admirable;
  as a scientific statement, which they must be taken to be if any one is
  justified in comparing them with another scientific statement, they fail
  to convey any intelligible conception to my mind.</p>

<p><!-- Page 121 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page121"></a>{121}</span></p>

  <p>The account proceeds: "And darkness was upon the face of the deep." So
  be it; but where, then, is the likeness to the celestial nebulæ, of the
  existence of which we should know nothing unless they shone with a light
  of their own? "And the spirit of God moved upon the face of the waters."
  I have met with no form of the nebular hypothesis which involves anything
  analogous to this process.</p>

  <p>I have said enough to explain some of the difficulties which arise in
  my mind, when I try to ascertain whether there is any foundation for the
  contention that the statements contained in the first two verses of
  Genesis are supported by the nebular hypothesis. The result does not
  appear to me to be exactly favourable to that contention. The nebular
  hypothesis assumes the existence of matter, having definite properties,
  as its foundation. Whether such matter was created a few thousand years
  ago, or whether it has existed through an eternal series of metamorphoses
  of which our present universe is only the last stage, are alternatives,
  neither of which is scientifically untenable, and neither scientifically
  demonstrable. But science knows nothing of any stage in which the
  universe could be said, in other than a metaphorical and popular sense,
  to be formless or empty; or in any respect less the seat of law and order
  than it is now. One might as well talk of a fresh-laid hen's egg being
  "without form and void," because the chick therein is potential and not
  actual, as apply such terms to the nebulous mass which contains a
  potential solar system. <!-- Page 122 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page122"></a>{122}</span></p>

  <p>Until some further enlightenment comes to me, then, I confess myself
  wholly unable to understand the way in which the nebular hypothesis is to
  be converted into an ally of the "Mosaic writer."<a name="NtA21"
  href="#Nt21"><sup>[21]</sup></a></p>

  <p>But Mr. Gladstone informs us that Professor Dana and Professor Guyot
  are prepared to prove that the "first or cosmogonical portion of the
  Proem not only accords with, but teaches, the nebular hypothesis." There
  is no one to whose authority on geological questions I am more readily
  disposed to bow than that of my eminent friend Professor Dana. But I am
  familiar with what he has previously said on this topic in his well-known
  and standard work, into which, strangely enough, it does not seem to have
  occurred to Mr. Gladstone to look before he set out upon his present
  undertaking; and unless Professor Dana's latest contribution (which I
  have not yet met with) takes up altogether new ground, I am afraid I
  shall <!-- Page 123 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page123"></a>{123}</span>not be able to extricate myself, by its
  help, from my present difficulties.</p>

  <p>It is a very long time since I began to think about the relations
  between modern scientifically ascertained truths and the cosmogonical
  speculations of the writer of Genesis; and, as I think that Mr. Gladstone
  might have been able to put his case with a good deal more force if he
  had thought it worth while to consult the last chapter of Professor
  Dana's admirable <i>Manual of Geology</i>, so I think he might have been
  made aware that he was undertaking an enterprise of which he had not
  counted the cost, if he had chanced upon a discussion of the subject
  which I published in 1877.<a name="NtA22"
  href="#Nt22"><sup>[22]</sup></a></p>

  <p>Finally, I should like to draw the attention of those who take
  interest in these topics to the weighty words of one of the most learned
  and moderate of Biblical critics:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  de disserter, à perte de vue, sur l'accord du récit mosaïque avec les

</blockquote>

  <p>In my paper on the "Interpreters of Nature and the Interpreters of
  Genesis," while freely availing myself of the rights of a scientific
  critic, I endeavoured to keep the expression of my views well within
  those <!-- Page 124 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page124"></a>{124}</span>bounds of courtesy which are set by
  self-respect and consideration for others. I am therefore glad to be
  favoured with Mr. Gladstone's acknowledgment of the success of my
  efforts. I only wish that I could accept all the products of Mr.
  Gladstone's gracious appreciation, but there is one about which, as a
  matter of honesty, I hesitate. In fact, if I had expressed my meaning
  better than I seem to have done, I doubt if this particular proffer of
  Mr. Gladstone's thanks would have been made.</p>

  <p>To my mind, whatever doctrine professes to be the result of the
  application of the accepted rules of inductive and deductive logic to its
  subject-matter; and accepts, within the limits which it sets to itself,
  the supremacy of reason, is Science. Whether the subject-matter consists
  of realities or unrealities, truths or falsehoods, is quite another
  question. I conceive that ordinary geometry is science, by reason of its
  method, and I also believe that its axioms, definitions, and conclusions
  are all true. However, there is a geometry of four dimensions, which I
  also believe to be science, because its method professes to be strictly
  scientific. It is true that I cannot conceive four dimensions in space,
  and therefore, for me, the whole affair is unreal. But I have known men
  of great intellectual powers who seemed to have no difficulty either in
  conceiving them, or, at any rate, in imagining how they could conceive
  them; and, therefore, four-dimensioned geometry comes under my notion of
  science. So I think astrology is a science, in so far as it professes to
  reason logically from principles <!-- Page 125 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page125"></a>{125}</span>established by just
  inductive methods. To prevent misunderstanding, perhaps I had better add
  that I do not believe one whit in astrology; but no more do I believe in
  Ptolemaic astronomy, or in the catastrophic geology of my youth, although
  these, in their day, claimed&mdash;and, to my mind, rightly
  claimed&mdash;the name of science. If nothing is to be called science but
  that which is exactly true from beginning to end, I am afraid there is
  very little science in the world outside mathematics. Among the physical
  sciences, I do not know that any could claim more than that it is true
  within certain limits, so narrow that, for the present at any rate, they
  may be neglected. If such is the case, I do not see where the line is to
  be drawn between exactly true, partially true, and mainly untrue forms of
  science. And what I have said about the current theology at the end of my
  paper [p. <a href="#page95">95</a>] leaves, I think, no doubt as to the
  category in which I rank it. For all that, I think it would be not only
  unjust, but almost impertinent, to refuse the name of science to the
  <i>Summa</i> of St. Thomas or to the <i>Institutes</i> of Calvin.</p>

  <p>&nbsp;</p>

  <p>In conclusion, I confess that my supposed "unjaded appetite" for the
  sort of controversy in which it needed not Mr. Gladstone's express
  declaration to tell us he is far better practised than I am (though
  probably, without another express declaration, no one would have
  suspected that his controversial fires are burning low) is already
  satiated.</p>

  <p>In "Elysium" we conduct scientific discussions in <!-- Page 126
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page126"></a>{126}</span>a different
  medium, and we are liable to threatenings of asphyxia in that "atmosphere
  of contention" in which Mr. Gladstone has been able to live, alert and
  vigorous beyond the common race of men, as if it were purest mountain
  air. I trust that he may long continue to seek truth, under the difficult
  conditions he has chosen for the search, with unabated energy&mdash;I had
  almost said fire&mdash;</p>

  <p>But Elysium suits my less robust constitution better, and I beg leave
  to retire thither, not sorry for my experience of the other

<blockquote class="b1n">

<p class="cenhead"><span class="sc">Note on the Proper Sense of the "Mosaic" Narrative of the Creation.</span></p>

  <p>It has been objected to my argument from Leviticus (p. <a
  href="#page103">103</a>), that the Hebrew words translated by "creeping
  things" in Genesis i. 24 and Leviticus xi. 29, are different; namely,
  "reh-mes" in the former, "sheh-retz" in the latter. The obvious reply to
  this objection is that the question is not one of words but of the
  meaning of words. To borrow an illustration from our own language, if
  "crawling things" had been used by the translators in Genesis and
  "creeping things" in Leviticus, it would not have been necessarily
  implied that they intended to denote different groups of animals.
  "Sheh-retz" is employed in a wider sense than "reh-mes." There are
  "sheh-retz" of the waters, of the earth, of the air, and of the land.
  Leviticus speaks of land reptiles, among other animals, as "sheh-retz";
  Genesis speaks of all creeping land animals, among which land reptiles
  are necessarily included, as "reh-mes." Our translators, therefore, <!--
  Page 127 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page127"></a>{127}</span>have
  given the true sense when they render both "sheh-retz" and "reh-mes" by
  "creeping things."</p>

  <p>Having taken a good deal of trouble to show what Genesis i.-ii. 4 does
  not mean, in the preceding pages, perhaps it may be well that I should
  briefly give my opinion as to what it does mean. I conceive that the
  unknown author of this part of the Hexateuchal compilation believed, and
  meant his readers to believe, that his words, as they understood
  them&mdash;that is to say, in their ordinary natural sense&mdash;conveyed
  the "actual historical truth." When he says that such and such things
  happened, I believe him to mean that they actually occurred and not that
  he imagined or dreamed them; when he says "day," I believe he uses the
  word in the popular sense; when he says "made" or "created," I believe he
  means that they came into being by a process analogous to that which the
  people whom he addressed called "making" or "creating"; and I think that,
  unless we forget our present knowledge of nature, and, putting ourselves
  back into the position of a Ph&oelig;nician or a Chaldæan philosopher,
  start from his conception of the world, we shall fail to grasp the
  meaning of the Hebrew writer. We must conceive the earth to be an
  immovable, more or less flattened, body, with the vault of heaven above,
  the watery abyss below and around. We must imagine sun, moon, and stars
  to be "set" in a "firmament" with, or in, which they move; and above
  which is yet another watery mass. We must consider "light" and "darkness"
  to be things, the alternation of which constitutes day and night,
  independently of the existence of sun, moon, and stars. We must further
  suppose that, as in the case of the story of the deluge, the Hebrew
  writer was acquainted with a Gentile (probably Chaldæan or Accadian)
  account of the origin of things, in which he substantially believed, but
  which he stripped of all its idolatrous associations by substituting
  "Elohim" for Ea, Anu, Bel, and the like.</p>

  <p>From this point of view the first verse strikes the keynote of the
  whole. In the beginning "Elohim<a name="NtA24"
  href="#Nt24"><sup>[24]</sup></a> created the heaven and the earth."
  Heaven and earth were not primitive existences from which the gods
  proceeded, as the Gentiles taught; on the contrary, the "Powers" preceded
  and created heaven and earth. <!-- Page 128 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page128"></a>{128}</span>Whether by "creation" is meant "causing to
  be where nothing was before" or "shaping of something which pre-existed,"
  seems to me to be an insoluble question.</p>

  <p>As I have pointed out, the second verse has an interesting parallel in
  Jeremiah iv. 23: "I beheld the earth, and, lo, it was waste and void; and
  the heavens, and they had no light." I conceive that there is no more
  allusion to chaos in the one than in the other. The earth-disk lay in its
  watery envelope, like the yolk of an egg in the <i>glaire</i>, and the
  spirit, or breath, of Elohim stirred the mass. Light was created as a
  thing by itself; and its antithesis "darkness" as another thing. It was
  supposed to be the nature of these two to alternate, and a pair of
  alternations constituted a "day" in the sense of an unit of time.</p>

  <p>The next step was, necessarily, the formation of that "firmament," or
  dome over the earth-disk, which was supposed to support the celestial
  waters; and in which sun, moon, and stars were conceived to be set, as in
  a sort of orrery. The earth was still surrounded and covered by the lower
  waters, but the upper were separated from it by the "firmament," beneath
  which what we call the air lay. A second alternation of darkness and
  light marks the lapse of time.</p>

  <p>After this, the waters which covered the earth-disk, under the
  firmament, were drawn away into certain regions, which became seas, while
  the part laid bare became dry land. In accordance with the notion,
  universally accepted in antiquity, that moist earth possesses the
  potentiality of giving rise to living beings, the land, at the command of
  Elohim, "put forth" all sorts of plants. They are made to appear thus
  early, not, I apprehend, from any notion that plants are lower in the
  scale of being than animals (which would seem to be inconsistent with the
  prevalence of tree worship among ancient people), but rather because
  animals obviously depend on plants; and because, without crops and
  harvests, there seemed to be no particular need of heavenly signs for the
  seasons.</p>

  <p>These were provided by the fourth day's work. Light existed already;
  but now vehicles for the distribution of light, in a special manner and
  with varying degrees of intensity, were provided. I conceive that the
  previous alternations of light and darkness were supposed to go on; but
  that the "light" was <!-- Page 129 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page129"></a>{129}</span>strengthened during the daytime by the
  sun, which, as a source of heat as well as of light, glided up the
  firmament from the east, and slid down in the west, each day. Very
  probably each day's sun was supposed to be a new one. And, as the light
  of the day was strengthened by the sun, so the darkness of the night was
  weakened by the moon, which regularly waxed and waned every month. The
  stars are, as it were, thrown in. And nothing can more sharply mark the
  doctrinal purpose of the author, than the manner in which he deals with
  the heavenly bodies, which the Gentiles identified so closely with their
  gods, as if they were mere accessories to the almanac.</p>

  <p>Animals come next in order of creation, and the general notion of the
  writer seems to be that they were produced by the medium in which they
  live; that is to say, the aquatic animals by the waters and the
  terrestrial animals by the land. But there was a difficulty about flying
  things, such as bats, birds, and insects. The cosmogonist seems to have
  had no conception of "air" as an elemental body. His "elements" are earth
  and water, and he ignores air as much as he does fire. Birds "fly above
  the earth in the open firmament" or "on the face of the expanse" of
  heaven. They are not said to fly through the air. The choice of a
  generative medium for flying things, therefore, seemed to lie between
  water and earth; and, if we take into account the conspicuousness of the
  great flocks of water-birds and the swarms of winged insects, which
  appear to arise from water, I think the preference of water becomes
  intelligible. However, I do not put this forward as more than a probable
  hypothesis. As to the creation of aquatic animals on the fifth, that of
  land animals on the sixth day, and that of man last of all, I presume the
  order was determined by the fact that man could hardly receive dominion
  over the living world before it existed; and that the "cattle" were not
  wanted until he was about to make his appearance. The other terrestrial
  animals would naturally be associated with the cattle.</p>

  <p>The absurdity of imagining that any conception, analogous to that of a
  zoological classification, was in the mind of the writer will be
  apparent, when we consider that the fifth day's work must include the
  zoologist's <i>Cetacea</i>, <i>Sirenia</i>, and seals,<a name="NtA25"
  href="#Nt25"><sup>[25]</sup></a> all of which are <!-- Page 130 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page130"></a>{130}</span><i>Mammalia</i>; all
  birds, turtles, sea-snakes and, presumably, the fresh water
  <i>Reptilia</i> and <i>Amphibia</i>; with the great majority of
  <i>Invertebrata</i>.</p>

  <p>The creation of man is announced as a separate act, resulting from a
  particular resolution of Elohim to "make man in our image, after our
  likeness." To learn what this remarkable phrase means we must turn to the
  fifth chapter of Genesis, the work of the same writer. "In the day that
  Elohim created man, in the likeness of Elohim made he him; male and
  female created he them; and blessed them and called their name Adam in
  the day when they were created. And Adam lived an hundred and thirty
  years and begat <i>a son</i> in his own likeness, after his image; and
  called his name Seth." I find it impossible to read this passage without
  being convinced that, when the writer says Adam was made in the likeness
  of Elohim, he means the same sort of likeness as when he says that Seth
  was begotten in the likeness of Adam. Whence it follows that his
  conception of Elohim was completely anthropomorphic.</p>

  <p>&nbsp;</p>

  <p>In all this narrative I can discover nothing which differentiates it,
  in principle, from other ancient cosmogonies, except the rejection of all
  gods, save the vague, yet anthropomorphic, Elohim, and the assigning to
  them anteriority and superiority to the world. It is as utterly
  irreconcilable with the assured truths of modern science, as it is with
  the account of the origin of man, plants, and animals given by the writer
  of the second chief constituent of the Hexateuch in the second chapter of
  Genesis. This extraordinary story starts with the assumption of the
  existence of a rainless earth, devoid of plants and herbs of the field.
  The creation of living beings begins with that of a solitary man; the
  next thing that happens is the laying out of the Garden of Eden, and the
  causing the growth from its soil of every tree "that is pleasant to the
  sight and good for food"; the third act is the formation out of the
  ground of "every beast of the field, and every fowl of the air"; the
  fourth and last, the manufacture of the first woman from a rib, extracted
  from Adam, while in a state of anæsthesia.</p>

  <p>Yet there are people who not only profess to take this monstrous
  legend seriously; but who declare it to be reconcilable with the
  Elohistic account of the creation!</p>

<h3>IV</h3>

<h3>THE EVOLUTION OF THEOLOGY: AN ANTHROPOLOGICAL
STUDY</h3>

  <p>I conceive that the origin, the growth, the decline, and the fall of
  those speculations respecting the existence, the powers, and the
  dispositions of beings analogous to men, but more or less devoid of
  corporeal qualities, which may be broadly included under the head of
  theology, are phenomena the study of which legitimately falls within the
  province of the anthropologist. And it is purely as a question of
  anthropology (a department of biology to which I have at various times
  given a good deal of attention) that I propose to treat of the evolution
  of theology in the following pages.</p>

  <p>With theology as a code of dogmas which are to be believed, or at any
  rate repeated, under penalty of present or future punishment, or as a
  storehouse of anæsthetics for those who find the pains of life too hard
  to bear, I have nothing to do; and, so far as it may be possible, I shall
  avoid the expression of any opinion as to the objective truth or
  falsehood of the systems of theological speculation of which I may <!--
  Page 132 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page132"></a>{132}</span>find
  occasion to speak. From my present point of view, theology is regarded as
  a natural product of the operations of the human mind, under the
  conditions of its existence, just as any other branch of science, or the
  arts of architecture, or music, or painting are such products. Like them,
  theology has a history. Like them also, it is to be met with in certain
  simple and rudimentary forms; and these can be connected by a multitude
  of gradations, which exist or have existed, among people of various ages
  and races, with the most highly developed theologies of past and present
  times. It is not my object to interfere, even in the slightest degree,
  with beliefs which anybody holds sacred; or to alter the conviction of
  any one who is of opinion that, in dealing with theology, we ought to be
  guided by considerations different from those which would be thought
  appropriate if the problem lay in the province of chemistry or of
  mineralogy. And if people of these ways of thinking choose to read beyond
  the present paragraph, the responsibility for meeting with anything they
  may dislike rests with them and not with me.</p>

  <p>&nbsp;</p>

  <p>We are all likely to be more familiar with the theological history of
  the Israelites than with that of any other nation. We may therefore fitly
  make it the first object of our studies; and it will be convenient to
  commence with that period which lies between the invasion of Canaan and
  the early days of the monarchy, and answers to the eleventh and twelfth
  <!-- Page 133 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page133"></a>{133}</span>centuries <span class="scac">B.C.</span>
  or thereabouts. The evidence on which any conclusion as to the nature of
  Israelitic theology in those days must be based is wholly contained in
  the Hebrew Scriptures&mdash;an agglomeration of documents which certainly
  belong to very different ages, but of the exact dates and authorship of
  any one of which (except perhaps one or two of the prophetical writings)
  there is no evidence, either internal or external, so far as I can
  discover, of such a nature as to justify more than a confession of
  ignorance, or, at most, an approximate conclusion. In this venerable
  record of ancient life, miscalled a book, when it is really a library
  comparable to a selection of works from English literature between the
  times of Beda and those of Milton, we have the stratified deposits (often
  confused and even with their natural order inverted) left by the stream
  of the intellectual and moral life of Israel during many centuries. And,
  embedded in these strata, there are numerous remains of forms of thought
  which once lived, and which, though often unfortunately mere fragments,
  are of priceless value to the anthropologist. Our task is to rescue these
  from their relatively unimportant surroundings, and by careful comparison
  with existing forms of theology to make the dead world which they record
  live again. In other words, our problem is palæontological, and the
  method pursued must be the same as that employed in dealing with other
  fossil remains.</p>

  <p>Among the richest of the fossiliferous strata to which I have alluded
  are the books of Judges and <!-- Page 134 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page134"></a>{134}</span>Samuel.<a name="NtA26"
  href="#Nt26"><sup>[26]</sup></a> It has often been observed that these
  writings stand out, in marked relief from those which precede and follow
  them, in virtue of a certain archaic freshness and of a greater freedom
  from traces of late interpolation and editorial trimming. Jephthah,
  Gideon, and Samson are men of old heroic stamp, who would look as much in
  place in a Norse Saga as where they are; and if the varnish-brush of
  later respectability has passed over these memoirs of the mighty men of a
  wild age, here and there, it has not succeeded in effacing, or even in
  seriously obscuring, the essential characteristics of the theology
  traditionally ascribed to their epoch.</p>

  <p>There is nothing that I have met with in the results of Biblical
  criticism inconsistent with the conviction that these books give us a
  fairly trustworthy account of Israelitic life and thought in the times
  which they cover; and, as such, apart from the great literary merit of
  many of their episodes, they possess the interest of being, perhaps, the
  oldest genuine history, as apart from mere chronicles on the one hand and
  mere legends on the other, at present accessible to us.</p>

  <p>But it is often said with exultation by writers of <!-- Page 135
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page135"></a>{135}</span>one party, and
  often admitted, more or less unwillingly, by their opponents, that these
  books are untrustworthy, by reason of being full of obviously unhistoric
  tales. And, as a notable example, the narrative of Saul's visit to the
  so-called "witch of Endor" is often cited. As I have already intimated, I
  have nothing to do with theological partisanship, either heterodox or
  orthodox, nor, for my present purpose, does it matter very much whether
  the story is historically true, or whether it merely shows what the
  writer believed; but, looking at the matter solely from the point of view
  of an anthropologist, I beg leave to express the opinion that the account
  of Saul's necromantic expedition is quite consistent with probability.
  That is to say, I see no reason whatever to doubt, firstly, that Saul
  made such a visit; and, secondly, that he and all who were present,
  including the wise woman of Endor herself, would have given, with entire
  sincerity, very much the same account of the business as that which we
  now read in the twenty-eighth chapter of the first book of Samuel; and I
  am further of opinion that this story is one of the most important of
  those fossils, to which I have referred, in the material which it offers
  for the reconstruction of the theology of the time. Let us therefore
  study it attentively&mdash;not merely as a narrative which, in the
  dramatic force of its gruesome simplicity, is not surpassed, if it is
  equalled, by the witch scenes in Macbeth&mdash;but as a piece of evidence
  bearing on an important anthropological problem.</p>

  <p>We are told (1 Sam. xxviii.) that Saul, encamped <!-- Page 136
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page136"></a>{136}</span>at Gilboa,
  became alarmed by the strength of the Philistine army gathered at Shunem.
  He therefore "inquired of Jahveh," but "Jahveh answered him not, neither
  by dreams, nor by Urim, nor by prophets."<a name="NtA27"
  href="#Nt27"><sup>[27]</sup></a> Thus deserted by Jahveh, Saul, in his
  extremity, bethought him of "those that had familiar spirits, and the
  wizards," whom he is said, at some previous time, to have "put out of the
  land"; but who seem, nevertheless, to have been very imperfectly
  banished, since Saul's servants, in answer to his command to seek him a
  woman "that hath a familiar spirit," reply without a sign of hesitation
  or of fear, "Behold, there is a woman that hath a familiar spirit at
  Endor"; just as, in some parts of England, a countryman might tell any
  one who did not look like a magistrate or a policeman, where a "wise
  woman" was to be met with. Saul goes to this woman, who, after being
  assured of immunity, asks, "Whom shall I bring up to thee?" whereupon
  Saul says, "Bring me up Samuel." The woman immediately sees an
  apparition. But to Saul nothing is visible, for he asks, "What seest
  thou?" And the woman replies, "I see Elohim coming up out of the earth."
  Still the spectre remains invisible to Saul, for he asks, "What form is
  he of?" And she replies, "An old man cometh up, and he is covered with a
  robe." So far, therefore, the wise woman unquestionably plays the part of
  a "medium," and Saul is dependent upon her version of what happens.</p>

<p><!-- Page 137 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page137"></a>{137}</span></p>

  <p>The account continues:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>And Saul perceived that it was Samuel, and he bowed with his face to
  the ground and did obeisance. And Samuel said to Saul, Why hast thou
  disquieted me to bring me up? And Saul answered, I am sore distressed:
  for the Philistines make war against me, and Elohim is departed from me
  and answereth me no more, neither by prophets nor by dreams; therefore I
  have called thee that thou mayest make known unto me what I shall do. And
  Samuel said, Wherefore then dost thou ask of me, seeing that Jahveh is
  departed from thee and is become thine adversary? And Jahveh hath wrought
  for himself, as he spake by me, and Jahveh hath rent the kingdom out of
  thine hand and given it to thy neighbour, even to David. Because thou
  obeyedst not the voice of Jahveh and didst not execute his fierce wrath
  upon Amalek, therefore hath Jahveh done this thing unto thee this day.
  Moreover, Jahveh will deliver Israel also with thee into the hand of the
  Philistines; and to-morrow shalt thou and thy sons be with me: Jahveh
  shall deliver the host of Israel also into the hand of the Philistines.
  Then Saul fell straightway his full length upon the earth and was sore
  afraid because of the words of Samuel ... (v. 14-20).</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>The statement that Saul "perceived" that it was Samuel is not to be
  taken to imply that, even now, Saul actually saw the shade of the
  prophet, but only that the woman's allusion to the prophetic mantle and
  to the aged appearance of the spectre convinced him that it was Samuel.
  Reuss<a name="NtA28" href="#Nt28"><sup>[28]</sup></a> in fact translates
  the passage "Alors Saul reconnut que c'était Samuel." <!-- Page 138
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page138"></a>{138}</span>Nor does the
  dialogue between Saul and Samuel necessarily, or probably, signify that
  Samuel spoke otherwise than by the voice of the wise woman. The
  Septuagint does not hesitate to call her <span title="engastrimuthos" class="grk"
  >&#x1F10;&gamma;&gamma;&alpha;&sigma;&tau;&rho;&#x1F77;&mu;&upsilon;&theta;&omicron;&sigmaf;</span>,
  that is to say, a ventriloquist, implying that it was she who
  spoke&mdash;and this view of the matter is in harmony with the fact that
  the exact sense of the Hebrew words which are translated as "a woman that
  hath a familiar spirit" is "a woman mistress of <i>Ob</i>." <i>Ob</i>
  means primitively a leather bottle, such as a wine skin, and is applied
  alike to the necromancer and to the spirit evoked. Its use, in these
  senses, appears to have been suggested by the likeness of the hollow
  sound emitted by a half-empty skin when struck, to the sepulchral tones
  in which the oracles of the evoked spirits were uttered by the medium. It
  is most probable that, in accordance with the general theory of spiritual
  influences which obtained among the old Israelites, the spirit of Samuel
  was conceived to pass into the body of the wise woman, and to use her
  vocal organs to speak in his own name&mdash;for I cannot discover that
  they drew any clear distinction between possession and inspiration.<a
  name="NtA29" href="#Nt29"><sup>[29]</sup></a></p>

  <p>If the story of Saul's consultation of the occult powers is to be
  regarded as an authentic narrative, or, at any rate, as a statement which
  is perfectly veracious so far as the intention of the narrator
  goes&mdash;and, as I have said, I see no reason for refusing it this
  character&mdash;it will be found, on further consideration, <!-- Page 139
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page139"></a>{139}</span>to throw a
  flood of light, both directly and indirectly, on the theology of Saul's
  countrymen&mdash;that is to say, upon their beliefs respecting the nature
  and ways of spiritual beings.</p>

  <p>Even without the confirmation of other abundant evidences to the same
  effect, it leaves no doubt as to the existence, among them, of the
  fundamental doctrine that man consists of a body and of a spirit, which
  last, after the death of the body, continues to exist as a ghost. At the
  time of Saul's visit to Endor, Samuel was dead and buried; but that his
  spirit would be believed to continue to exist in Sheol may be concluded
  from the well-known passage in the song attributed to Hannah, his
  mother:&mdash;</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p>Jahveh killeth and maketh alive,</p>
      <p>He bringeth down to Sheol and bringeth up</p>
    </div>

    <div class="stanza">
      <p>(1 Sam. ii. 6).</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>And it is obvious that this Sheol was thought to be a place
  underground in which Samuel's spirit had been disturbed by the
  necromancer's summons, and in which, after his return thither, he would
  be joined by the spirits of Saul and his sons when they had met with
  their bodily death on the hill of Gilboa. It is further to be observed
  that the spirit, or ghost, of the dead man presents itself as the image
  of the man himself&mdash;it is the man not merely in his ordinary
  corporeal presentment (even down to the prophet's mantle) but in his
  moral and intellectual characteristics. Samuel, who had begun as Saul's
  friend and ended as his bitter enemy, gives it to be understood that he
  is annoyed at Saul's presumption in <!-- Page 140 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page140"></a>{140}</span>disturbing him; and
  that, in Sheol, he is as much the devoted servant of Jahveh and as much
  empowered to speak in Jahveh's name as he was during his sojourn in the
  upper air.</p>

  <p>It appears now to be universally admitted that, before the exile, the
  Israelites had no belief in rewards and punishments after death, nor in
  anything similar to the Christian heaven and hell; but our story proves
  that it would be an error to suppose that they did not believe in the
  continuance of individual existence after death by a ghostly simulacrum
  of life. Nay, I think it would be very hard to produce conclusive
  evidence that they disbelieved in immortality; for I am not aware that
  there is anything to show that they thought the existence of the souls of
  the dead in Sheol ever came to an end. But they do not seem to have
  conceived that the condition of the souls in Sheol was in any way
  affected by their conduct in life. If there was immortality, there was no
  state of retribution in their theology. Samuel expects Saul and his sons
  to come to him in Sheol.</p>

  <p>The next circumstance to be remarked is that the name of <i>Elohim</i>
  is applied to the spirit which the woman sees "coming up out of the
  earth," that is to say, from Sheol. The Authorised Version translates
  this in its literal sense "gods." The Revised Version gives "god" with
  "gods" in the margin. Reuss renders the word by "spectre," remarking in a
  note that it is not quite exact; but that the word Elohim expresses
  "something divine, that is to say, superhuman, commanding respect and
  terror" (<i>Histoire <!-- Page 141 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page141"></a>{141}</span>des Israelites</i>, p. 321). Tuch, in his
  commentary on Genesis, and Thenius, in his commentary on Samuel, express
  substantially the same opinion. Dr. Alexander (in Kitto's
  <i>Cyclopædia</i> s. v. "God") has the following instructive
  remarks:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>[<i>Elohim</i> is] sometimes used vaguely to describe unseen powers or
  superhuman beings that are not properly thought of as divine. Thus the
  witch of Endor saw "Elohim ascending out of the earth" (1 Sam. xxviii.
  13), meaning thereby some beings of an unearthly, superhuman character.
  So also in Zechariah xii. 8, it is said "the house of David shall be as
  Elohim, as the angel of the Lord," where, as the transition from Elohim
  to the angel of the Lord is a minori ad majus, we must regard the former
  as a vague designation of supernatural powers.</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>Dr. Alexander speaks here of "beings"; but there is no reason to
  suppose that the wise woman of Endor referred to anything but a solitary
  spectre; and it is quite clear that Saul understood her in this sense,
  for he asks, "What form is <span class="scac">HE</span> of?"</p>

  <p>This fact, that the name of Elohim is applied to a ghost, or
  disembodied soul, conceived as the image of the body in which it once
  dwelt, is of no little importance. For it is well known that the same
  term was employed to denote the gods of the heathen, who were thought to
  have definite quasi-corporeal forms and to be as much real entities as
  any other Elohim.<a name="NtA30" href="#Nt30"><sup>[30]</sup></a> The
  difference which was supposed to exist <!-- Page 142 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page142"></a>{142}</span>between the different
  Elohim was one of degree, not one of kind. Elohim was, in logical
  terminology, the genus of which ghosts, Chemosh, Dagon, Baal, and Jahveh
  were species. The Israelite believed Jahveh to be immeasurably superior
  to all other kinds of Elohim. The inscription on the Moabite stone shows
  that King Mesa held Chemosh to be, as unquestionably, the superior of
  Jahveh. But if Jahveh was thus supposed to differ only in degree from the
  undoubtedly zoomorphic or anthropomorphic "gods of the nations," why is
  it to be assumed that he also was not thought of as having a human shape?
  It is possible for those who forget that the time of the great prophetic
  writers is at least as remote from that of Saul as our day is from that
  of Queen Elizabeth, to insist upon interpreting the gross notions current
  in the earlier age and among the mass of the people by the refined
  conceptions promulgated by a few select spirits centuries later. But if
  we take the language constantly used concerning the Deity in the books of
  Genesis, Exodus, Joshua, Judges, Samuel, or Kings, in its natural sense
  (and I am aware of no valid reason which can be given for taking it in
  any other sense), there cannot, to my mind, be a doubt that Jahveh was
  conceived by those from whom the substance of these books is mainly
  derived, to possess the appearance and the intellectual and moral
  attributes of a man; and, indeed, of a man of just that type with which
  the Israelites were familiar in their stronger and intellectually abler
  rulers and leaders. In a well-known passage of Genesis (i. 27) Elohim is
  said to <!-- Page 143 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page143"></a>{143}</span>have "created man in his own image, in the
  image of Elohim created he him." It is "man" who is here said to be the
  image of Elohim&mdash;not man's soul alone, still less his "reason," but
  the whole man. It is obvious that for those who called a manlike ghost
  Elohim, there could be no difficulty in conceiving any other Elohim under
  the same aspect. And if there could be any doubt on this subject, surely
  it cannot stand in the face of what we find in the fifth chapter, where,
  immediately after a repetition of the statement that "Elohim created man,
  in the likeness of Elohim made he him," it is said that Adam begat Seth
  "in his own likeness, after his image." Does this mean that Seth
  resembled Adam only in a spiritual and figurative sense? And if that
  interpretation of the third verse of the fifth chapter of Genesis is
  absurd, why does it become reasonable in the first verse of the same
  chapter?</p>

  <p>But let us go further. Is not the Jahveh who "walks in the garden in
  the cool of the day"; from whom one may hope to "hide oneself among the
  trees"; of whom it is expressly said that "Moses and Aaron, Nadab and
  Abihu, and seventy of the elders of Israel," saw the Elohim of Israel
  (Exod. xxiv. 9-11); and that, although the seeing Jahveh was understood
  to be a high crime and misdemeanour, worthy of death, under ordinary
  circumstances, yet, for this once, he "laid not his hand on the nobles of
  Israel"; "that they beheld Elohim and did eat and drink"; and that
  afterwards Moses saw his back (Exod. xxxiii. 23)&mdash;is not this Deity
  conceived as manlike in form? <!-- Page 144 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page144"></a>{144}</span>Again, is not the Jahveh who eats with
  Abraham under the oaks at Mamre, who is pleased with the "sweet savour"
  of Noah's sacrifice, to whom sacrifices are said to be "food"<a
  name="NtA31" href="#Nt31"><sup>[31]</sup></a>&mdash;is not this Deity
  depicted as possessed of human appetites? If this were not the current
  Israelitish idea of Jahveh even in the eighth century <span
  class="scac">B.C.</span>, where is the point of Isaiah's scathing
  admonitions to his countrymen: "To what purpose is the multitude of your
  sacrifices unto me? saith Jahveh: I am full of the burnt-offerings of
  rams and the fat of fed beasts; and I delight not in the blood of
  bullocks, or of lambs, or of he-goats" (Isa. i. 11). Or of Micah's
  inquiry, "Will Jahveh be pleased with thousands of rams or with ten
  thousands of rivers of oil?" (vi. 7). And in the innumerable passages in
  which Jahveh is said to be jealous of other gods, to be angry, to be
  appeased, and to repent; in which he is represented as casting off Saul
  because the king does not quite literally execute a command of the most
  ruthless severity; or as smiting Uzzah to death because the unfortunate
  man thoughtlessly, but naturally enough, put out his hand to stay the ark
  from falling&mdash;can any one deny that the old Israelites conceived
  Jahveh not only in the image of a man, but in that of a changeable,
  irritable, and, occasionally, violent man? There appears to me, then, to
  be no reason to doubt that the notion of likeness to man, which was
  indubitably held of the <!-- Page 145 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page145"></a>{145}</span>ghost Elohim, was carried out consistently
  throughout the whole series of Elohim, and that Jahveh-Elohim was thought
  of as a being of the same substantially human nature as the rest, only
  immeasurably more powerful for good and for evil.</p>

  <p>The absence of any real distinction between the Elohim of different
  ranks is further clearly illustrated by the corresponding absence of any
  sharp delimitation between the various kinds of people who serve as the
  media of communication between them and men. The agents through whom the
  lower Elohim are consulted are called necromancers, wizards, and
  diviners, and are looked down upon by the prophets and priests of the
  higher Elohim; but the "seer" connects the two, and they are all alike in
  their essential characters of media. The wise woman of Endor was believed
  by others, and, I have little doubt, believed herself, to be able to
  "bring up" whom she would from Sheol, and to be inspired, whether in
  virtue of actual possession by the evoked Elohim, or otherwise, with a
  knowledge of hidden things. I am unable to see that Saul's servant took
  any really different view of Samuel's powers, though he may have believed
  that he obtained them by the grace of the higher Elohim. For when Saul
  fails to find his father's asses, his servant says to him&mdash;</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>Behold, there is in this city a man of Elohim, and he is a man that is
  held in honour; all that he saith cometh surely to pass: now let us go
  thither; peradventure he can tell us concerning our journey whereon we
  go. Then said Saul to his servant, But behold if we go, what shall we
  bring the man? for the bread is spent in our vessels and there is not a
  present to <!-- Page 146 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page146"></a>{146}</span>bring to the man of Elohim. What have we?
  And the servant answered Saul again and said, Behold I have in my hand
  the fourth part of a shekel of silver: that will I give to the man of
  Elohim to tell us our way. (Beforetime in Israel when a man went to
  inquire of Elohim, then he said, Come and let us go to the Seer: for he
  that is now called a Prophet was beforetime called a Seer<a name="NtA32"
  href="#Nt32"><sup>[32]</sup></a>) (1 Sam. ix. 6-10).</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>In fact, when, shortly afterwards, Saul accidentally meets Samuel, he
  says, "Tell me, I pray thee, where the Seer's house is." Samuel answers,
  "I am the Seer." Immediately afterwards Samuel informs Saul that the
  asses are found, though how he obtained his knowledge of the fact is not
  stated. It will be observed that Samuel is not spoken of here as, in any
  special sense, a seer or prophet of Jahveh, but as a "man of
  Elohim"&mdash;that is to say, a seer having access to the "spiritual
  powers," just as the wise woman of Endor might have been said to be a
  "woman of Elohim"&mdash;and the narrator's or editor's explanatory note
  seems to indicate that "Prophet" is merely a name, introduced later than
  the time of Samuel, for a superior kind of "Seer," or "man of Elohim."<a
  name="NtA33" href="#Nt33"><sup>[33]</sup></a></p>

  <p>Another very instructive passage shows that Samuel was not only
  considered to be diviner, seer, and prophet in one, but that he was also,
  to all intents and purposes, priest of Jahveh&mdash;though, <!-- Page 147
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page147"></a>{147}</span>according to
  his biographer, he was not a member of the tribe of Levi. At the outset
  of their acquaintance, Samuel says to Saul, "Go up before me into the
  high place," where, as the young maidens of the city had just before told
  Saul, the Seer was going, "for the people will not eat till he come,
  because he doth bless the sacrifice" (1 Sam. x. 12). The use of the word
  "bless" here&mdash;as if Samuel were not going to sacrifice, but only to
  offer a blessing or thanksgiving&mdash;is curious. But that Samuel really
  acted as priest seems plain from what follows. For he not only asks Saul
  to share in the customary sacrificial feast, but he disposes in Saul's
  favour of that portion of the victim which the Levitical legislation,
  doubtless embodying old customs, recognises as the priest's special
  property.<a name="NtA34" href="#Nt34"><sup>[34]</sup></a></p>

  <p>Although particular persons adopted the profession of media between
  men and Elohim, there was no limitation of the power, in the view of
  ancient Israel, to any special class of the population. Saul inquires of
  Jahveh and builds him altars on his own account; and in the very
  remarkable story told in the <!-- Page 148 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page148"></a>{148}</span>fourteenth chapter of the first book of
  Samuel (v. 37-46), Saul appears to conduct the whole process of
  divination, although he has a priest at his elbow. David seems to do the
  same.</p>

  <p>Moreover, Elohim constantly appear in dreams&mdash;which in old Israel
  did not mean that, as we should say, the subject of the appearance
  "dreamed he saw the spirit"; but that he veritably saw the Elohim which,
  as a soul, visited his soul while his body was asleep. And, in the course
  of the history of Israel, Jahveh himself thus appears to all sorts of
  persons, non-Israelites as well as Israelites. Again, the Elohim possess,
  or inspire, people against their will, as in the case of Saul and Saul's
  messengers, and then these people prophesy&mdash;that is to say,
  "rave"&mdash;and exhibit the ungoverned gestures attributed by a later
  age to possession by malignant spirits. Apart from other evidence to be
  adduced by and by, the history of ancient demonology and of modern
  revivalism does not permit me to doubt that the accounts of these
  phenomena given in the history of Saul may be perfectly historical.</p>

  <p>In the ritual practices, of which evidence is to be found in the books
  of Judges and Samuel, the chief part is played by sacrifices, usually
  burnt offerings. Whenever the aid of the Elohim of Israel is sought, or
  thanks are considered due to him, an altar is built, and oxen, sheep, and
  goats are slaughtered and offered up. Sometimes the entire victim is
  burnt as a holocaust; more frequently only certain parts, notably the fat
  about the kidneys, are burnt on the <!-- Page 149 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page149"></a>{149}</span>altar. The rest is
  properly cooked; and, after the reservation of a part for the priest, is
  made the foundation of a joyous banquet, in which the sacrificer, his
  family, and such guests as he thinks fit to invite, participate.<a
  name="NtA35" href="#Nt35"><sup>[35]</sup></a> Elohim was supposed to
  share in the feast, and it has been already shown that that which was set
  apart on the altar, or consumed by fire, was spoken of as the food of
  Elohim, who was thought to be influenced by the costliness, or by the
  pleasant smell, of the sacrifice in favour of the sacrificer.</p>

  <p>All this bears out the view that, in the mind of the old Israelite,
  there was no difference, save one of degree, between one Elohim and
  another. It is true that there is but little direct evidence to show that
  the old Israelites shared the widespread belief of their own, and indeed
  of all times, that the spirits of the dead not only continue to exist,
  but are capable of a ghostly kind of feeding and are grateful for such
  aliment as can be assimilated by their attenuated substance, and even for
  clothes, ornaments, and weapons.<a name="NtA36"
  href="#Nt36"><sup>[36]</sup></a> That they were familiar with this
  doctrine in the time of the captivity is suggested by the well-known
  reference of Ezekiel (xxxii. 27) to the "mighty that are fallen of the
  uncircumcised, which <!-- Page 150 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page150"></a>{150}</span>are gone down to [Sheol] hell with their
  weapons of war, and have laid their swords under their heads." Perhaps
  there is a still earlier allusion in the "giving of food for the dead"
  spoken of in Deuteronomy (xxvi. 14).<a name="NtA37"
  href="#Nt37"><sup>[37]</sup></a></p>

  <p>It must be remembered that the literature of the old Israelites, as it
  lies before us, has been subjected to the revisal of strictly
  monotheistic editors, violently opposed to all kinds of idolatry, who are
  not likely to have selected from the materials at their disposal any
  obvious evidence, either of the practice under discussion, or of that
  ancestor-worship which is so closely related to it, for preservation in
  the permanent records of their people.</p>

  <p>The mysterious objects known as <i>Teraphim</i>, which are
  occasionally mentioned in Judges, Samuel, and elsewhere, however, can
  hardly be interpreted otherwise than as indications of the existence both
  of ancestor-worship and of image-worship in old Israel. <!-- Page 151
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page151"></a>{151}</span>The teraphim
  were certainly images of family gods, and, as such, in all probability
  represented deceased ancestors. Laban indignantly demands of his
  son-in-law, "Wherefore hast thou stolen my Elohim?" which Rachel, who
  must be assumed to have worshipped Jacob's God, Jahveh, had carried off,
  obviously because she, like her father, believed in their divinity. It is
  not suggested that Jacob was in any way scandalised by the idolatrous
  practices of his favourite wife, whatever he may have thought of her
  honesty when the truth came to light; for the teraphim seem to have
  remained in his camp, at least until he "hid" his strange gods "under the
  oak that was by Shechem" (Gen. xxxv. 4). And indeed it is open to
  question if he got rid of them then, for the subsequent history of Israel
  renders it more than doubtful whether the teraphim were regarded as
  "strange gods" even as late as the eighth century <span
  class="scac">B.C.</span></p>

  <p>The writer of the books of Samuel takes it quite as a matter of course
  that Michal, daughter of one royal Jahveh worshipper and wife of the
  servant of Jahveh <i>par excellence</i>, the pious David, should have her
  teraphim handy, in her and David's chamber, when she dresses them up in
  their bed into a simulation of her husband, for the purpose of deceiving
  her father's messengers. Even one of the early prophets, Hosea, when he
  threatens that the children of Israel shall abide many days without
  "ephod or teraphim" (iii. 4), appears to regard both as equally proper
  appurtenances of the suspended worship of Jahveh, and equally certain to
  be restored when that is resumed. <!-- Page 152 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page152"></a>{152}</span>When we further take
  into consideration that only in the reign of Hezekiah was the brazen
  serpent, preserved in the temple and believed to be the work of Moses,
  destroyed, and the practice of offering incense to it, that is,
  worshipping it, abolished&mdash;that Jeroboam could set up "calves of
  gold" for Israel to worship, with apparently none but a political object,
  and certainly with no notion of creating a schism among the worshippers
  of Jahveh, or of repelling the men of Judah from his standard&mdash;it
  seems obvious, either that the Israelites of the tenth and eleventh
  centuries <span class="scac">B.C.</span> knew not the second commandment,
  or that they construed it merely as part of the prohibition to worship
  any supreme god other than Jahveh, which precedes it.</p>

  <p>In seeking for information about the teraphim, I lighted upon the
  following passage in the valuable article on that subject by Archdeacon
  Farrar, in Kitto's <i>Cyclopædia of Biblical Literature</i>, which is so
  much to the purpose of my argument, that I venture to quote it in
  full:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>The main and certain results of this review are that the teraphim were
  rude human images; that the use of them was an antique Aramaic custom;
  that there is reason to suppose them to have been images of deceased
  ancestors; that they were consulted oracularly; that they were not
  confined to Jews; that their use continued down to the latest period of
  Jewish history; and lastly, that although the enlightened prophets and
  strictest later kings regarded them as idolatrous, the priests were much
  less averse to such images, and their cult was not considered in any way
  repugnant to the pious worship of Elohim, nay, even to the worship of him
  "under the awful title of Jehovah." In fact, they involved <i>a
  monotheistic idolatry very different indeed from <!-- Page 153 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page153"></a>{153}</span>polytheism</i>; and the
  tolerance of them by priests, as compared with the denunciation of them
  by the prophets, offers a close analogy to the views of the Roman
  Catholics respecting pictures and images as compared with the views of
  Protestants. It was against this use of idolatrous symbols and emblems in
  a monotheistic worship that the <i>second</i> commandment was directed,
  whereas the first is aimed against the graver sin of direct polytheism.
  But the whole history of Israel shows how utterly and how early the law
  must have fallen into desuetude. The worship of the golden calf and of
  the calves at Dan and Bethel, against which, so far as we know, neither
  Elijah nor Elisha said a single word; the tolerance of high places,
  teraphim and betylia; the offering of incense for centuries to the brazen
  serpent destroyed by Hezekiah; the occasional glimpses of the most
  startling irregularities sanctioned apparently even in the temple worship
  itself, prove most decisively that a pure monotheism and an independence
  of symbols was the result of a slow and painful course of God's
  disciplinal dealings among the noblest thinkers of a single nation, and
  not, as is so constantly and erroneously urged, the instinct of the whole
  Semitic race; in other words, one single branch of the Semites was under
  God's providence <i>educated</i> into pure monotheism only by centuries
  of misfortune and series of inspired men (vol. iii. p. 986).</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>It appears to me that the researches of the anthropologist lead him to
  conclusions identical in substance, if not in terms, with those here
  enunciated as the result of a careful study of the same subject from a
  totally different point of view.</p>

  <p>There is abundant evidence in the books of Samuel and elsewhere that
  an article of dress termed an <i>ephod</i> was supposed to have a
  peculiar efficacy in enabling the wearer to exercise divination by means
  of Jahveh-Elohim. Great and long continued have been the disputes as to
  the exact nature of the ephod&mdash;whether it always means something to
  wear, or <!-- Page 154 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page154"></a>{154}</span>whether it sometimes means an image. But
  the probabilities are that it usually signifies a kind of waistcoat or
  broad zone, with shoulder-straps, which the person who "inquired of
  Jahveh" put on. In 1 Samuel xxiii. 2 David appears to have inquired
  without an ephod, for Abiathar the priest is said to have "come down with
  an ephod in his hand" only subsequently. And then David asks for it
  before inquiring of Jahveh whether the men of Keilah would betray him or
  not. David's action is obviously divination pure and simple; and it is
  curious that he seems to have worn the ephod himself and not to have
  employed Abiathar as a medium. How the answer was given is not clear,
  though the probability is that it was obtained by casting lots. The
  <i>Urim</i> and <i>Thummim</i> seem to have been two such lots of a
  peculiarly sacred character, which were carried in the pocket of the high
  priest's "breastplate." This last was worn along with the ephod.</p>

  <p>With the exception of one passage (1 Sam. xiv. 18) the ark is ignored
  in the history of Saul. But in this place the Septuagint reads "ephod"
  for ark, while in 1 Chronicles xiii. 3 David says that "we sought not
  unto it [the ark] in the days of Saul." Nor does Samuel seem to have paid
  any regard to the ark after its return from Philistia; though, in his
  childhood, he is said to have slept in "the temple of Jahveh, where the
  ark of Elohim was" (1 Sam. iii. 3), at Shiloh, and there to have been the
  seer of the earliest apparitions vouchsafed to him by Jahveh. The space
  between the cherubim or winged images on the <!-- Page 155 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page155"></a>{155}</span>canopy or cover
  (<i>Kapporeth</i>) of this holy chest was held to be the special seat of
  Jahveh&mdash;the place selected for a temporary residence of the Supreme
  Elohim who had, after Aaron and Phineas, Eli and his sons for priests and
  seers. And, when the ark was carried to the camp at Eben-ezer, there can
  be no doubt that the Israelites, no less than the Philistines, held that
  "Elohim is come into the camp" (iv. 7), and that the one, as much as the
  other, conceived that the Israelites had summoned to their aid a powerful
  ally in "these (or this) mighty Elohim"&mdash;elsewhere called
  Jahve-Sabaoth, the Jahveh of Hosts. If the "temple" at Shiloh was the
  pentateuchal tabernacle, as is suggested by the name of "tent of meeting"
  given to it in 1 Samuel ii. 22, it was essentially a large tent, though
  constituted of very expensive and ornate materials; if, on the other
  hand, it was a different edifice, there can be little doubt that this
  "house of Jahveh" was built on the model of an ordinary house of the
  time. But there is not the slightest evidence that, during the reign of
  Saul, any greater importance attached to this seat of the cult of Jahveh
  than to others. Sanctuaries, and "high places" for sacrifice, were
  scattered all over the country from Dan to Beersheba. And, as Samuel is
  said to have gone up to one of these high places to bless the sacrifice,
  it may be taken for tolerably certain that he knew nothing of the
  Levitical laws which severely condemn the high places and those who
  sacrifice away from the sanctuary hallowed by the presence of the
  ark.</p>

  <p>There is no evidence that, during the time of the <!-- Page 156
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page156"></a>{156}</span>Judges and of
  Samuel, any one occupied the position of the high priest of later days.
  And persons who were neither priests nor Levites sacrificed and divined
  or "inquired of Jahveh," when they pleased and where they pleased,
  without the least indication that they, or any one else in Israel at that
  time, knew they were doing wrong. There is no allusion to any special
  observance of the Sabbath; and the references to circumcision are
  indirect.</p>

  <p>&nbsp;</p>

  <p>Such are the chief articles of the theological creed of the old
  Israelites, which are made known to us by the direct evidence of the
  ancient record to which we have had recourse, and they are as remarkable
  for that which they contain as for that which is absent from them. They
  reveal a firm conviction that, when death takes place, a something termed
  a soul or spirit leaves the body and continues to exist in Sheol for a
  period of indefinite duration, even though there is no proof of any
  belief in absolute immortality; that such spirits can return to earth to
  possess and inspire the living; that they are, in appearance and in
  disposition, likenesses of the men to whom they belonged, but that, as
  spirits, they have larger powers and are freer from physical limitations;
  that they thus form a group among a number of kinds of spiritual
  existences known as Elohim, of whom Jahveh, the national God of Israel,
  is one; that, consistently with this view, Jahveh was conceived as a sort
  of spirit, human in aspect and in senses, and with many human passions,
  but with immensely greater intelligence and power than any <!-- Page 157
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page157"></a>{157}</span>other Elohim,
  whether human or divine. Further, the evidence proves that this belief
  was the basis of the Jahveh-worship to which Samuel and his followers
  were devoted; that there is strong reason for believing, and none for
  doubting, that idolatry, in the shape of the worship of the family gods
  or teraphim, was practised by sincere and devout Jahveh-worshippers; that
  the ark, with its protective tent or tabernacle, was regarded as a
  specially, but by no means exclusively, favoured sanctuary of Jahveh;
  that the ephod appears to have had a particular value for those who
  desired to divine by the help of Jahveh; and that divination by lots was
  practised before Jahveh. On the other hand, there is not the slightest
  evidence of any belief in retribution after death, but the contrary;
  ritual obligations have at least as strong sanction as moral; there are
  clear indications that some of the most stringent of the Levitical laws
  were unknown even to Samuel; priests often appear to be superseded by
  laymen, even in the performance of sacrifices and divination; and no line
  of demarcation can be drawn between necromancer, wizard, seer, prophet,
  and priest, each of whom is regarded, like all the rest, as a medium of
  communication between the world of Elohim and that of living men.</p>

  <p>&nbsp;</p>

  <p>The theological system thus defined offers to the anthropologist no
  feature which is devoid of a parallel in the known theologies of other
  races of mankind, even of those who inhabit parts of the world most
  remote from Palestine. And the foundation of the <!-- Page 158 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page158"></a>{158}</span>whole, the ghost
  theory, is exactly that theological speculation which is the most widely
  spread of all, and the most deeply rooted among uncivilised men. I am
  able to base this statement, to some extent, on facts within my own
  knowledge. In December 1848, H.M.S. <i>Rattlesnake</i>, the ship to which
  I then belonged, was anchored off Mount Ernest, an island in Torres
  Straits. The people were few and well disposed; and, when a friend of
  mine (whom I will call B.) and I went ashore, we made acquaintance with
  an old native, Paouda by name. In course of time we became quite intimate
  with the old gentleman, partly by the rendering of mutual good offices,
  but chiefly because Paouda believed he had discovered that B. was his
  father-in-law. And his grounds for this singular conviction were very
  remarkable. We had made a long stay at Cape York hard by; and, in
  accordance with a theory which is widely spread among the Australians,
  that white men are the reincarnated spirits of black men, B. was held to
  be the ghost, or <i>narki</i>, of a certain Mount Ernest native, one
  Antarki, who had lately died, on the ground of some real or fancied
  resemblance to the latter. Now Paouda had taken to wife a daughter of
  Antarki's, named Domani, and as soon as B. informed him that he was the
  ghost of Antarki, Paouda at once admitted the relationship and acted upon
  it. For, as all the women on the island had hidden away in fear of the
  ship, and we were anxious to see what they were like, B. pleaded
  pathetically with Paouda that it would be very unkind not to let him see
  his daughter and grandchildren. <!-- Page 159 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page159"></a>{159}</span>After a good deal of hesitation and the
  exaction of pledges of deep secrecy, Paouda consented to take B., and
  myself as B.'s friend, to see Domani and the three daughters, by whom B.
  was received quite as one of the family, while I was courteously welcomed
  on his account.</p>

  <p>This scene made an impression upon me which is not yet effaced. It
  left no question on my mind of the sincerity of the strange ghost theory
  of these savages, and of the influence which their belief has on their
  practical life. I had it in my mind, as well as many a like result of
  subsequent anthropological studies, when, in 1869,<a name="NtA38"
  href="#Nt38"><sup>[38]</sup></a> I wrote as follows:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>There are savages without God in any proper sense of the word, but
  none without ghosts. And the Fetishism, Ancestor-worship, Hero-worship,
  and Demonology of primitive savages are all, I believe, different manners
  of expression of their belief in ghosts, and of the anthropomorphic
  interpretation of out-of-the-way events which is its concomitant.
  Witchcraft and sorcery are the practical expressions of these beliefs;
  and they stand in the same relation to religious worship as the simple
  anthropomorphism of children or savages does to theology.</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>I do not quote myself with any intention of making a claim to
  originality in putting forth this view; for I have since discovered that
  the same conception is virtually contained in the great <i>Discours sur
  l'Histoire Universelle</i> of Bossuet, now more than two centuries
  old:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>Le culte des hommes morts faisoit presque tout le fond de l'idolâtrie:

</blockquote>

  <p>Among more modern writers J.&nbsp;G. Müller, in his excellent <i>Geschichte
  der amerikanischen Urreligionen</i> (1855), clearly recognises
  "gespensterhafter Geisterglaube" as the foundation of all savage and
  semi-civilised theology, and I need do no more than mention the important
  developments of the same view which are to be found in Mr. Tylor's
  <i>Primitive Culture</i>, and in the writings of Mr. Herbert Spencer,
  especially his recently-published <i>Ecclesiastical Institutions</i>.<a
  name="NtA40" href="#Nt40"><sup>[40]</sup></a></p>

  <p>It is a matter of fact that, whether we direct our attention to the
  older conditions of civilised societies, in Japan, in China, in
  Hindostan, in Greece, or in Rome,<a name="NtA41"
  href="#Nt41"><sup>[41]</sup></a> we find underlying all other theological
  notions the belief in ghosts, with its inevitable concomitant sorcery;
  and a primitive cult in the shape of a worship of ancestors, which is
  essentially an attempt to please, or appease, their ghosts. The <!-- Page
  161 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page161"></a>{161}</span>same thing
  is true of old Mexico and Peru, and of every semi-civilised or savage
  people who have developed a definite cult; and in those who, like the
  natives of Australia, have not even a cult, the belief in, and fear of,
  ghosts is as strong as anywhere else. The most clearly demonstrable
  article of the theology of the Israelites in the eleventh and twelfth
  centuries <span class="scac">B.C.</span> is therefore simply the article
  which is to be found in all primitive theologies, namely, the belief that
  a man has a soul which continues to exist after death for a longer or
  shorter time, and may return, as a ghost, with a divine, or at least
  demonic, character, to influence for good or evil (and usually for evil)
  the affairs of the living. But the correspondence between the old
  Israelitic and other archaic forms of theology extends to details. If, in
  order to avoid all chance of direct communication, we direct our
  attention to the theology of semi-civilised people, such as the
  Polynesian Islanders, separated by the greatest possible distance, and by
  every conceivable barrier, from the inhabitants of Palestine, we shall
  find not merely that all the features of old-Israelitic theology, which
  are revealed in the records cited, are found among them; but that extant
  information as to the inner mind of these people tends to remove many of
  the difficulties which those who have not studied anthropology find in
  the Hebrew narrative.</p>

  <p>One of the best sources, if not the best source, of information on
  these topics is Mariner's <i>Tonga Islands</i>, which tells us of the
  condition of Cook's "Friendly Islanders" eighty years ago, before <!--
  Page 162 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page162"></a>{162}</span>European influence was sensibly felt among
  them. Mariner, a youth of fair education and of no inconsiderable natural
  ability (as the work which was drawn up from the materials he furnished
  shows), was about fifteen years of age when his ship was attacked and
  plundered by the Tongans: he remained four years in the islands,
  familiarised himself with the language, lived the life of the people,
  became intimate with many of them, and had every opportunity of
  acquainting himself with their opinions, as well as with their habits and
  customs. He seems to have been devoid of prejudices, theological or
  other, and the impression of strict accuracy which his statements convey
  has been justified by all the knowledge of Polynesian life which has been
  subsequently acquired.</p>

  <p>It is desirable, therefore, to pay close attention to that which
  Mariner tells us about the theological views of these people:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>The human soul,<a name="NtA42" href="#Nt42"><sup>[42]</sup></a> after
  its separation from the body, is termed a <i>hotooa</i> (a god or
  spirit), and is believed to exist in the shape of the body; to have the
  same propensities as during life, but to be corrected by a more
  enlightened understanding, by which it readily distinguishes good from
  evil, truth from falsehood, right from wrong; having the same attributes
  as the original gods, but in a minor degree, and having its dwelling for
  ever in the happy regions of Bolotoo, holding the same rank in regard to
  other souls as during this life; it has, however, the power of returning
  to Tonga to inspire priests, relations, or others, or to appear in dreams
  to those it wishes to admonish; <!-- Page 163 --><span class="pagenum"><a

  form of a ghost or apparition; but this power of reappearance at Tonga
  particularly belongs to the souls of chiefs rather than of matabooles
  (vol. ii. p. 130).</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>The word "hotooa" is the same as that which is usually spelt "atua" by
  Polynesian philologues, and it will be convenient to adopt this spelling.
  Now under this head of "<i>Atuas</i> or supernatural intelligent beings"
  the Tongans include:&mdash;</p>

  <p>From this it appears that the "Atuas" of the Polynesian are exactly
  equivalent to the "Elohim" of the old Israelite.<a name="NtA44"
  href="#Nt44"><sup>[44]</sup></a> They comprise everything spiritual, from
  a ghost to a god, and from "the merely tutelar gods to particular private
  families" (vol. ii. p. 104), to Tá-li-y-Tooboó, who was the national god
  of Tonga. The Tongans had no doubt that these Atuas daily and hourly
  influenced their destinies and could, conversely, be influenced by them.
  <!-- Page 164 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page164"></a>{164}</span>Hence their "piety," the incessant acts of
  sacrificial worship which occupied their lives, and their belief in omens
  and charms. Moreover, the Atuas were believed to visit particular
  persons,&mdash;their own priests in the case of the higher gods, but
  apparently anybody in that of the lower,&mdash;and to inspire them by a
  process which was conceived to involve the actual residence of the god,
  for the time being, in the person inspired, who was thus rendered capable
  of prophesying (vol. ii. p. 100). For the Tongan, therefore, inspiration
  indubitably was possession.</p>

  <p>When one of the higher gods was invoked, through his priest, by a
  chief who wished to consult the oracle, or, in old Israelitic
  phraseology, to "inquire of," the god, a hog was killed and cooked over
  night, and, together with plantains, yams, and the materials for making
  the peculiar drink <i>kava</i> (of which the Tongans were very fond), was
  carried next day to the priest. A circle, as for an ordinary
  kava-drinking entertainment, was then formed; but the priest, as the
  representative of the god, took the highest place, while the chiefs sat
  outside the circle, as an expression of humility calculated to please the
  god.</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>As soon as they are all seated the priest is considered as inspired,
  the god being supposed to exist within him from that moment. He remains
  for a considerable time in silence with his hands clasped before him, his
  eyes are cast down and he rests perfectly still. During the time the
  victuals are being shared out and the kava preparing, the matabooles
  sometimes begin to consult him; sometimes he answers, and at other times
  not; in either case he remains with his eyes cast down. Frequently he
  will not utter a word till the repast is finished and the kava too. When
  he speaks he generally begins in a low <!-- Page 165 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page165"></a>{165}</span>and very altered tone
  of voice, which gradually rises to nearly its natural pitch, though
  sometimes a little above it. All that he says is supposed to be the
  declaration of the god, and he accordingly speaks in the first person, as
  if he were the god. All this is done generally without any apparent
  inward emotion or outward agitation; but, on some occasions, his
  countenance becomes fierce, and as it were inflamed, and his whole frame
  agitated with inward feeling; he is seized with an universal trembling,
  the perspiration breaks out on his forehead, and his lips turning black
  are convulsed; at length tears start in floods from his eyes, his breast
  heaves with great emotion, and his utterance is choked. These symptoms
  gradually subside. Before this paroxysm comes on, and after it is over,
  he often eats as much as four hungry men under other circumstances could
  devour. The fit being now gone off, he remains for some time calm and
  then takes up a club that is placed by him for the purpose, turns it over
  and regards it attentively; he then looks up earnestly, now to the right,
  now to the left, and now again at the club; afterwards he looks up again
  and about him in like manner, and then again fixes his eyes on the club,
  and so on for several times. At length he suddenly raises the club, and,
  after a moment's pause, strikes the ground or the adjacent part of the
  house with considerable force; immediately the god leaves him, and he
  rises up and retires to the back of the ring among the people (vol. i.
  pp. 100, 101).</p>

  <p>The phenomena thus described, in language which, to any one who is
  familiar with the manifestations of abnormal mental states among
  ourselves, bears the stamp of fidelity, furnish a most instructive
  commentary upon the story of the wise woman of Endor. As in the latter,
  we have the possession by the spirit or soul (Atua, Elohim), the strange
  voice, the speaking in the first person. Unfortunately nothing (beyond
  the loud cry) is mentioned as to the state of the wise woman of Endor.
  But what we learn from other sources (<i>e.g.</i> 1 Sam. x. 20-24)
  respecting the physical <!-- Page 166 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page166"></a>{166}</span>concomitants of inspiration among the old
  Israelites has its exact equivalent in this and other accounts of
  Polynesian prophetism. An excellent authority, Moerenhout, who lived
  among the people of the Society Islands many years and knew them well,
  says that, in Tahiti, the <i>rôle</i> of the prophet had very generally
  passed out of the hands of the priests into that of private persons who
  professed to represent the god, often assumed his name, and in this
  capacity prophesied. I will not run the risk of weakening the force of
  Moerenhout's description of the prophetic state by translating
  it:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>Un individu, dans cet état, avait le bras gauche enveloppé d'un
  morceau d'étoffe, signe de la présence de la Divinité. Il ne parlait que
  d'un ton impérieux et véhément. Ses attaques, quand il allait
  prophétiser, étaient aussi effroyables qu'imposantes. Il tremblait
  d'abord de tous ses membres, la figure enflée, les yeux hagards, rouges
  et étincelants d'une expression sauvage. Il gesticulait, articulait des
  mots vides de sens, poussait des cris horribles qui faisaient tressaillir
  tous les assistans, et s'exaltait parfois au point qu'on n'osait pas
  l'approcher. Autour de lui, le silence de la terreur et du respect....
  C'est alors qu'il répondait aux questions, annonçait l'avenir, le destin
  des batailles, la volonté des dieux; et, chose étonnante! au sein de ce
  délire, de cet enthousiasme religieux, son langage était grave, imposant,
  son éloquence noble et persuasive.<a name="NtA45"
  href="#Nt45"><sup>[45]</sup></a></p>

</blockquote>

  <p>Just so Saul strips off his clothes, "prophesies" before Samuel, and
  lies down "naked all that day and night."</p>

  <p>Both Mariner and Moerenhout refuse to have recourse to the hypothesis
  of imposture in order to <!-- Page 167 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page167"></a>{167}</span>account for the inspired state of the
  Polynesian prophets. On the contrary, they fully believe in their
  sincerity. Mariner tells the story of a young chief, an acquaintance of
  his, who thought himself possessed by the Atua of a dead woman who had
  fallen in love with him, and who wished him to die that he might be near
  her in Bolotoo. And he died accordingly. But the most valuable evidence
  on this head is contained in what the same authority says about King
  Finow's son. The previous king, Toogoo Ahoo, had been assassinated by
  Finow, and his soul, become an Atua of divine rank in Bolotoo, had been
  pleased to visit and inspire Finow's son&mdash;with what particular
  object does not appear.</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>When this young chief returned to Hapai, Mr. Mariner, who was upon a
  footing of great friendship with him, one day asked him how he felt
  himself when the spirit of Toogoo Ahoo visited him; he replied that he
  could not well describe his feelings, but the best he could say of it
  was, that he felt himself all over in a glow of heat and quite restless
  and uncomfortable, and did not feel his own personal identity, as it
  were, but seemed to have a mind different from his own natural mind, his
  thoughts wandering upon strange and unusual subjects, although perfectly
  sensible of surrounding objects. He next asked him how he knew it was the
  spirit of Toogoo Ahoo? His answer was, "There's a fool! How can I tell
  you <i>how</i> I knew it? I felt and knew it was so by a kind of
  consciousness; my <i>mind</i> told me that it was Toogoo Ahoo" (vol. i.
  pp. 104, 105).</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>Finow's son was evidently made for a theological disputant, and fell
  back at once on the inexpugnable stronghold of faith when other evidence
  was lacking. "There's a fool! I know it is true, because I know it," is
  the exemplar and epitome of the <!-- Page 168 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page168"></a>{168}</span>sceptic-crushing process in other places
  than the Tonga Islands.</p>

  <p>The island of Bolotoo, to which all the souls (of the upper classes at
  any rate) repair after the death of the body, and from which they return
  at will to interfere, for good or evil, with the lives of those whom they
  have left behind, obviously answers to Sheol. In Tongan tradition this
  place of souls is a sort of elysium above ground, and pleasant enough to
  live in. But, in other parts of Polynesia, the corresponding locality,
  which is called Po, has to be reached by descending into the earth, and
  is represented dark and gloomy like Sheol. But it was not looked upon as
  a place of rewards and punishments in any sense. Whether in Bolotoo or in
  Po, the soul took the rank it had in the flesh; and, a shadow, lived
  among the shadows of the friends and houses and food of its previous
  life.</p>

  <p>The Tongan theologians recognised several hundred gods; but there was
  one, already mentioned as their national god, whom they regarded as far
  greater than any of the others, "as a great chief from the top of the sky
  down to the bottom of the earth" (Mariner, vol. ii. p. 106). He was also
  god of war, and the tutelar deity of the royal family, whoever happened
  to be the incumbent of the royal office for the time being. He had no
  priest except the king himself, and his visits, even to royalty, were few
  and far between. The name of this supreme deity was Tá-li-y-Tooboó, the
  literal meaning of which is said to be "Wait there, Tooboó," from which
  it would appear <!-- Page 169 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page169"></a>{169}</span>that the peculiar characteristic of
  Tá-li-y-Tooboó, in the eyes of his worshippers, was persistence of
  duration. And it is curious to notice, in relation to this circumstance,
  that many Hebrew philologers have thought the meaning of Jahveh to be
  best expressed by the word "Eternal." It would probably be difficult to
  express the notion of an eternal being, in a dialect so little fitted to
  convey abstract conceptions as Tongan, better than by that of one who
  always "waits there."</p>

  <p>The characteristics of the gods in Tongan theology are exactly those
  of men whose shape they are supposed to possess, only they have more
  intelligence and greater power. The Tongan belief that, after death, the
  human Atua more readily distinguishes good from evil, runs parallel with
  the old Israelitic conception of Elohim expressed in Genesis, "Ye shall
  be as Elohim, knowing good from evil." They further agreed with the old
  Israelites, that "all rewards for virtue and punishments for vice happen
  to men in this world only, and come immediately from the gods" (vol. ii.
  p. 100). Moreover, they were of opinion that though the gods approve of
  some kinds of virtue and are displeased with some kinds of vice, and, to
  a certain extent, protect or forsake their worshippers according to their
  moral conduct, yet neglect to pay due respect to the deities, and
  forgetfulness to keep them in good humour, might be visited with even
  worse consequences than moral delinquency. And those who will carefully
  study the so-called "Mosaic code" contained in the <!-- Page 170 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page170"></a>{170}</span>books of Exodus,
  Leviticus, and Numbers, will see that, though Jahveh's prohibitions of
  certain forms of immorality are strict and sweeping, his wrath is quite
  as strongly kindled against infractions of ritual ordinances. Accidental
  homicide may go unpunished, and reparation may be made for wilful theft.
  On the other hand, Nadab and Abihu, who "offered strange fire before
  Jahveh, which he had not commanded them," were swiftly devoured by
  Jahveh's fire; he who sacrificed anywhere except at the allotted place
  was to be "cut off from his people"; so was he who eat blood; and the
  details of the upholstery of the Tabernacle, of the millinery of the
  priests' vestments, and of the cabinet work of the ark, can plead direct
  authority from Jahveh, no less than moral commands.</p>

  <p>Amongst the Tongans, the sacrifices were regarded as gifts of food and
  drink offered to the divine Atuas, just as the articles deposited by the
  graves of the recently dead were meant as food for Atuas of lower rank. A
  kava root was a constant form of offering all over Polynesia. In the
  excellent work of the Rev. George Turner, entitled <i>Nineteen Years in
  Polynesia</i> (p. 241), I find it said of the Samoans (near neighbours of
  the Tongans):&mdash;</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p><i>The offerings</i> were principally cooked food. As in ancient
  Greece so in Samoa, the first cup was in honour of the god. It was either
  poured out on the ground or <i>waved</i> towards the heavens, reminding
  us again of the Mosaic ceremonies. The chiefs all drank a portion out of
  the same cup, according to rank; and after that, the food brought as an
  offering was divided and eaten "<i>there before the Lord</i>."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>In Tonga, when they consulted a god who had a <!-- Page 171 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page171"></a>{171}</span>priest, the latter, as
  representative of the god, had the first cup; but if the god, like
  Tá-li-y-Tooboó, had no priest, then the chief place was left vacant, and
  was supposed to be occupied by the god himself. When the first cup of
  kava was filled, the mataboole who acted as master of the ceremonies
  said, "Give it to your god," and it was offered, though only as a matter
  of form. In Tonga and Samoa there were many sacred places or
  <i>morais</i>, with houses of the ordinary construction, but which served
  as temples in consequence of being dedicated to various gods; and there
  were altars on which the sacrifices were offered; nevertheless there were
  few or no images. Mariner mentions none in Tonga, and the Samoans seem to
  have been regarded as no better than atheists by other Polynesians
  because they had none. It does not appear that either of these peoples
  had images even of their family or ancestral gods.</p>

  <p>In Tahiti and the adjacent islands, Moerenhout (t. i. p. 471) makes
  the very interesting observation, not only that idols were often absent,
  but that, where they existed, the images of the gods served merely as
  depositories for the proper representatives of the divinity. Each of
  these was called a <i>maro aurou</i>, and was a kind of girdle
  artistically adorned with red, yellow, blue, and black feathers&mdash;the
  red feathers being especially important&mdash;which were consecrated and
  kept as sacred objects within the idols. They were worn by great
  personages on solemn occasions, and conferred upon their wearers a sacred
  and almost divine character. There is no distinct evidence that the <!--
  Page 172 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page172"></a>{172}</span><i>maro aurou</i> was supposed to have any
  special efficacy in divination, but one cannot fail to see a certain
  parallelism between this holy girdle, which endowed its wearer with a
  particular sanctity, and the ephod.</p>

  <p>According to the Rev. R. Taylor, the New Zealanders formerly used the
  word <i>karakia</i> (now employed for "prayer") to signify a "spell,
  charm, or incantation," and the utterance of these karakias constituted
  the chief part of their cult. In the south, the officiating priest had a
  small image, "about eighteen inches long, resembling a peg with a carved
  head," which reminds one of the form commonly attributed to the
  teraphim.</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>The priest first bandaged a fillet of red parrot feathers under the
  god's chin, which was called his pahau or beard; this bandage was made of
  a certain kind of sennet, which was tied on in a peculiar way. When this
  was done it was taken possession of by the Atua, whose spirit entered it.
  The priest then either held it in the hand and vibrated it in the air,
  whilst the powerful karakia was repeated, or he tied a piece of string
  (formed of the centre of a flax leaf) round the neck of the image and
  stuck it in the ground. He sat at a little distance from it, leaning
  against a tuahu, a short stone pillar stuck in the ground in a slanting
  position, and holding the string in his hand, he gave the god a jerk to
  arrest his attention, lest he should be otherwise engaged, like Baal of
  old, either hunting, fishing, or sleeping, and therefore must be
  awaked.... The god is supposed to make use of the priest's tongue in
  giving a reply. Image-worship appears to have been confined to one part
  of the island. The Atua was supposed only to enter the image for the
  occasion. The natives declare they did not worship the image itself, but
  only the Atua it represented, and that the image was merely used as a way
  of approaching him.<a name="NtA46" href="#Nt46"><sup>[46]</sup></a></p>

</blockquote>

<p><!-- Page 173 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page173"></a>{173}</span></p>

  <p>This is the excuse for image-worship which the more intelligent
  idolaters make all the world over; but it is more interesting to observe
  that, in the present case, we seem to have the equivalents of divination
  by teraphim, with the aid of something like an ephod (which, however, is
  used to sanctify the image and not the priest) mixed up together. Many
  Hebrew archæologists have supposed that the term "ephod" is sometimes
  used for an image (particularly in the case of Gideon's ephod), and the
  story of Micah, in the book of Judges, shows that images were, at any
  rate, employed in close association with the ephod. If the pulling of the
  string to call the attention of the god seems as absurd to us as it
  appears to have done to the worthy missionary, who tells us of the
  practice, it should be recollected that the high priest of Jahveh was
  ordered to wear a garment fringed with golden bells.</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>And it shall be upon Aaron to minister; and the sound thereof shall be
  heard when he goeth in unto the holy place before Jahveh, and when he
  cometh out, that he die not (Exod. xxviii. 35).</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>An escape from the obvious conclusion suggested by this passage has
  been sought in the supposition that these bells rang for the sake of the
  worshippers, as at the elevation of the host in the Roman Catholic
  ritual; but then why should the priest be threatened with the well-known
  penalty for inadvisedly beholding the divinity?</p>

  <p>In truth, the intermediate step between the Maori practice and that of
  the old Israelites is furnished by <!-- Page 174 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page174"></a>{174}</span>the Kami temples in
  Japan. These are provided with bells which the worshippers who present
  themselves ring, in order to call the attention of the ancestor-god to
  their presence. Grant the fundamental assumption of the essentially human
  character of the spirit, whether Atua, Kami, or Elohim, and all these
  practices are equally rational.</p>

  <p>The sacrifices to the gods in Tonga, and elsewhere in Polynesia, were
  ordinarily social gatherings, in which the god, either in his own person
  or in that of his priestly representative, was supposed to take part.
  These sacrifices were offered on every occasion of importance, and even
  the daily meals were prefaced by oblations and libations of food and
  drink, exactly answering to those offered by the old Romans to their
  manes, penates, and lares. The sacrifices had no moral significance, but
  were the necessary result of the theory that the god was either a deified
  ghost of an ancestor or chief, or, at any rate, a being of like nature to
  these. If one wanted to get anything out of him, therefore, the first
  step was to put him in good humour by gifts; and if one desired to escape
  his wrath, which might be excited by the most trifling neglect or
  unintentional disrespect, the great thing was to pacify him by costly
  presents. King Finow appears to have been somewhat of a freethinker (to
  the great horror of his subjects), and it was only his untimely death
  which prevented him from dealing with the priest of a god, who had not
  returned a favourable answer to his supplications, as Saul dealt with the
  priests of the sanctuary of Jahveh at Nob. <!-- Page 175 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page175"></a>{175}</span>Nevertheless, Finow
  showed his practical belief in the gods during the sickness of a
  daughter, to whom he was fondly attached, in a fashion which has a close
  parallel in the history of Israel.</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>If the gods have any resentment against us, let the whole weight of
  vengeance fall on my head. I fear not their vengeance&mdash;but spare my
  child; and I earnestly entreat you, Toobo Totái [the god whom he had
  invoked], to exert all your influence with the other gods that I alone
  may suffer all the punishment they desire to inflict (vol. i. p.
  354).</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>So when the king of Israel has sinned by "numbering the people," and
  they are punished for his fault by a pestilence which slays seventy
  thousand innocent men, David cries to Jahveh:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>Lo, I have sinned, and I have done perversely: but these sheep, what
  have they done? let thine hand, I pray thee, be against me, and against
  my father's house (2 Sam. xxiv. 17).</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>Human sacrifices were extremely common in Polynesia; and, in Tonga,
  the "devotion" of a child by strangling was a favourite method of
  averting the wrath of the gods. The well-known instances of Jephthah's
  sacrifice of his daughter and of David's giving up the seven sons of Saul
  to be sacrificed by the Gibeonites "before Jahveh," appear to me to leave
  no doubt that the old Israelites, even when devout worshippers of Jahveh,
  considered human sacrifices, under certain circumstances, to be not only
  permissible but laudable. Samuel's hewing to pieces of the miserable
  captive, sole survivor of his nation, Agag, "before Jahveh," can hardly
  be viewed in any other light. The life of Moses is redeemed from Jahveh,
  who "sought <!-- Page 176 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page176"></a>{176}</span>to slay him," by Zipporah's symbolical
  sacrifice of her child, by the bloody operation of circumcision. Jahveh
  expressly affirms that the first-born males of men and beasts are devoted
  to him; in accordance with that claim, the first-born males of the beasts
  are duly sacrificed; and it is only by special permission that the claim
  to the first-born of men is waived, and it is enacted that they may be
  redeemed (Exod. xiii. 12-15). Is it possible to avoid the conclusion that
  immolation of their first-born sons would have been incumbent on the
  worshippers of Jahveh, had they not been thus specially excused? Can any
  other conclusion be drawn from the history of Abraham and Isaac? Does
  Abraham exhibit any indication of surprise when he receives the
  astounding order to sacrifice his son? Is there the slightest evidence
  that there was anything in his intimate and personal acquaintance with
  the character of the Deity, who had eaten the meat and drunk the milk
  which Abraham set before him under the oaks of Mamre, to lead him to
  hesitate&mdash;even to wait twelve or fourteen hours for a repetition of
  the command? Not a whit. We are told that "Abraham rose early in the
  morning" and led his only child to the slaughter, as if it were the most
  ordinary business imaginable. Whether the story has any historical
  foundation or not, it is valuable as showing that the writer of it
  conceived Jahveh as a deity whose requirement of such a sacrifice need
  excite neither astonishment, nor suspicion of mistake, on the part of his
  devotee. Hence, when the incessant human <!-- Page 177 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page177"></a>{177}</span>sacrifices in Israel,
  during the age of the kings, are put down to the influence of foreign
  idolatries, we may fairly inquire whether editorial Bowdlerising has not
  prevailed over historical truth.</p>

  <p>An attempt to compare the ethical standards of two nations, one of
  which has a written code, while the other has not, is beset with
  difficulties. With all that is strange and, in many cases, repulsive to
  us in the social arrangements and opinions respecting moral obligation
  among the Tongans, as they are placed before us, with perfect candour, in
  Mariner's account, there is much that indicates a strong ethical sense.
  They showed great kindliness to one another, and faithfulness in standing
  by their comrades in war. No people could have better observed either the
  third or the fifth commandment; for they had a particular horror of
  blasphemy, and their respectful tenderness towards their parents and,
  indeed, towards old people in general, was remarkable.</p>

  <p>It cannot be said that the eighth commandment was generally observed,
  especially where Europeans were concerned; but nevertheless a well-bred
  Tongan looked upon theft as a meanness to which he would not condescend.
  As to the seventh commandment, any breach of it was considered scandalous
  in women and as something to be avoided in self-respecting men, but among
  unmarried and widowed people chastity was held very cheap. Nevertheless
  the women were extremely well treated, and often showed themselves
  capable of great devotion and entire faithfulness. In the matter of
  cruelty, treachery, and <!-- Page 178 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page178"></a>{178}</span>bloodthirstiness, these islanders were
  neither better nor worse than most peoples of antiquity. It is to the
  credit of the Tongans that they particularly objected to slander; nor can
  covetousness be regarded as their characteristic; for Mariner
  says:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>When any one is about to eat, he always shares out what he has to
  those about him, without any hesitation, and a contrary conduct would be
  considered exceedingly vile and selfish (vol. ii. p. 145).</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>In fact, they thought very badly of the English when Mariner told them
  that his countrymen did not act exactly on that principle. It further
  appears that they decidedly belonged to the school of intuitive moral
  philosophers, and believed that virtue is its own reward; for</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>Many of the chiefs, on being asked by Mr. Mariner what motives they
  had for conducting themselves with propriety, besides the fear of
  misfortunes in this life, replied, the agreeable and happy feeling which
  a man experiences within himself when he does any good action or conducts
  himself nobly and generously as a man ought to do; and this question they
  answered as if they wondered such a question should be asked (vol. ii. p.
  161).</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>One may read from the beginning of the book of Judges to the end of
  the books of Samuel without discovering that the old Israelites had a
  moral standard which differs, in any essential respect (except perhaps in
  regard to the chastity of unmarried women), from that of the Tongans.
  Gideon, Jephthah, Samson, and David are strong-handed men, some of whom
  are not outdone by any Polynesian chieftain in the matter of murder and
  treachery; <!-- Page 179 --><span class="pagenum"><a

  violation of the primary duty of hospitality, proffered and accepted

</blockquote>

  <p>That the moral standard of Tongan life was less elevated than that
  indicated in the "Book of the Covenant" (Exod. xxi.-xxiii.) may be freely
  admitted. But then the evidence that this Book of the Covenant, and even
  the ten commandments as given in Exodus, were known to the Israelites of
  the time of Samuel and Saul, is (to say the least) by no means
  conclusive. The Deuteronomic version of the fourth commandment is
  hopelessly discrepant from that which stands in Exodus. Would any later
  writer have ventured to alter the commandments as given from Sinai, if he
  had had before him that which professed to be an accurate statement of
  the "ten words" in Exodus? And if the writer of <!-- Page 180 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page180"></a>{180}</span>Deuteronomy had not
  Exodus before him, what is the value of the claim of the version of the
  ten commandments therein contained to authenticity? From one end to the
  other of the books of Judges and Samuel, the only "commandments of
  Jahveh" which are specially adduced refer to the prohibition of the
  worship of other gods, or are orders given <i>ad hoc</i>, and have
  nothing to do with questions of morality.</p>

  <p>In Polynesia, the belief in witchcraft, in the appearance of spiritual
  beings in dreams, in possession as the cause of diseases, and in omens,
  prevailed universally. Mariner tells a story of a woman of rank who was
  greatly attached to King Finow, and who, for the space of six months
  after his death, scarcely ever slept elsewhere than on his grave, which
  she kept carefully decorated with flowers:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>One day she went, with the deepest affliction, to the house of
  Mo-oonga Toobó, the widow of the deceased chief, to communicate what had
  happened to her at the <i>fytoca</i> [grave] during several nights, and
  which caused her the greatest anxiety. She related that she had dreamed
  that the late How [king] appeared to her and, with a countenance full of
  disappointment, asked why there yet remained at Vavaoo so many
  evil-designing persons: for he declared that, since he had been at
  Bolotoo, his spirit had been disturbed<a name="NtA47"
  href="#Nt47"><sup>[47]</sup></a> by the evil machinations of wicked men
  conspiring against his son; but he declared that "the youth" should not
  be molested nor his power shaken by the spirit of rebellion; that he
  therefore came to her with a warning voice to prevent such disastrous
  consequences (vol. i. p. 424).</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>On inquiry it turned out that the charm of <i>tattao</i> had been
  performed on Finow's grave, with the view <!-- Page 181 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page181"></a>{181}</span>of injuring his son,
  the reigning king, and it is to be presumed that it was this sorcerer's
  work which had "disturbed" Finow's spirit. The Rev. Richard Taylor says
  in the work already cited: "The account given of the witch of Endor
  agrees most remarkably with the witches of New Zealand" (p. 45).</p>

  <p>The Tongans also believed in a mode of divination (essentially similar
  to the casting of lots) by the twirling of a cocoa-nut.</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>The object of inquiry ... is chiefly whether a sick person will
  recover; for this purpose the nut being placed on the ground, a relation
  of the sick person determines that, if the nut, when again at rest,
  points to such a quarter, the east for example, that the sick man will
  recover; he then prays aloud to the patron god of the family that he will
  be pleased to direct the nut so that it may indicate the truth; the nut
  being next spun, the result is attended to with confidence, at least with
  a full conviction that it will truly declare the intentions of the gods
  at the time (vol. ii. p. 227).</p>

  <p>Does not the action of Saul, on a famous occasion, involve exactly the
  same theological presuppositions?</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>Therefore Saul said unto Jahveh, the Elohim of Israel, Shew the right.
  And Jonathan and Saul were taken <i>by lot</i>: but the people escaped.

  <p>As the Israelites had great yearly feasts, so had the Polynesians; as
  the Israelites practised circumcision, so did many Polynesian people; as
  the Israelites had a complex and often arbitrary-seeming multitude of
  distinctions between clean and unclean things, and clean and unclean
  states of men, to which <!-- Page 182 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page182"></a>{182}</span>they attached great importance, so had the
  Polynesians their notions of ceremonial purity and their <i>tabu</i>, an
  equally extensive and strange system of prohibitions, violation of which
  was visited by death. These doctrines of cleanness and uncleanness no
  doubt may have taken their rise in the real or fancied utility of the
  prescriptions, but it is probable that the origin of many is indicated in
  the curious habit of the Samoans to make fetishes of living animals. It
  will be recollected that these people had no "gods made with hands," but
  they substituted animals for them.</p>

  <p>At his birth</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>every Samoan was supposed to be taken under the care of some tutelary
  god or <i>aitu</i> [ = Atua] as it was called. The help of perhaps half a
  dozen different gods was invoked in succession on the occasion, but the
  one who happened to be addressed just as the child was born was marked
  and declared to be the child's god for life.</p>

  <p>These gods were supposed to appear in some <i>visible incarnation</i>,
  and the particular thing in which his god was in the habit of appearing
  was, to the Samoan, an object of veneration. It was in fact his idol, and
  he was careful never to injure it or treat it with contempt. One, for
  instance, saw his god in the eel, another in the shark, another in the
  turtle, another in the dog, another in the owl, another in the lizard;
  and so on, throughout all the fish of the sea and birds and four-footed
  beasts and creeping things. In some of the shell-fish even, gods were
  supposed to be present. A man would eat freely of what was regarded as
  the incarnation of the god of another man, but the incarnation of his own
  particular god he would consider it death to injure or eat.<a

  <p>We have here that which appears to be the origin, or one of the
  origins, of food prohibitions, on the one <!-- Page 183 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page183"></a>{183}</span>hand, and of totemism
  on the other. When it is remembered that the old Israelities sprang from
  ancestors who are said to have resided near, or in, one of the great
  seats of ancient Babylonian civilisation, the city of Ur; that they had
  been, it is said for centuries, in close contact with the Egyptians; and
  that, in the theology of both the Babylonians and the Egyptians there is
  abundant evidence, notwithstanding their advanced social organisation, of
  the belief in spirits, with sorcery, ancestor-worship, the deification of
  animals, and the converse animalisation of gods&mdash;it obviously needs
  very strong evidence to justify the belief that the rude tribes of Israel
  did not share the notions from which their far more civilised neighbours
  had not emancipated themselves.</p>

  <p>But it is surely needless to carry the comparison further. Out of the
  abundant evidence at command, I think that sufficient has been produced
  to furnish ample grounds for the belief, that the old Israelites of the
  time of Samuel entertained theological conceptions which were on a level
  with those current among the more civilised of the Polynesian islanders,
  though their ethical code may possibly, in some respects, have been more
  advanced.<a name="NtA49" href="#Nt49"><sup>[49]</sup></a></p>

  <p>A theological system of essentially similar character, exhibiting the
  same fundamental conceptions respecting the continued existence and
  incessant interference in human affairs of disembodied spirits, prevails,
  or formerly prevailed, among the whole of <!-- Page 184 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page184"></a>{184}</span>the inhabitants of the
  Polynesian and Melanesian islands, and among the people of Australia,
  notwithstanding the wide differences in physical character and in grade
  of civilisation which obtain among them. And the same proposition is true
  of the people who inhabit the riverain shores of the Pacific Ocean,
  whether Dyaks, Malays, Indo-Chinese, Chinese, Japanese, the wild tribes
  of America, or the highly civilised old Mexicans and Peruvians. It is no
  less true of the Mongolic nomads of Northern Asia, of the Asiatic Aryans,
  and of the ancient Greeks and Romans, and it holds good among the
  Dravidians of the Dekhan and the negro tribes of Africa. No tribe of
  savages, which has yet been discovered, has been conclusively proved to
  have so poor a theological equipment as to be devoid of a belief in
  ghosts, and in the utility of some form of witchcraft in influencing
  those ghosts. And there is no nation, modern or ancient, which, even at
  this moment, has wholly given up the belief; and in which it has not, at
  one time or other, played a great part in practical life.</p>

  <p>This <i>sciotheism</i>,<a name="NtA50"
  href="#Nt50"><sup>[50]</sup></a> as it might be called, is found in
  several degrees of complexity, in rough correspondence with the stages of
  social organisation, and, like these, separated by no sudden breaks.</p>

  <p>In its simplest condition, such as may be met with among the
  Australian savages, theology is a mere <!-- Page 185 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page185"></a>{185}</span>belief in the
  existence, powers, and disposition (usually malignant) of ghostlike
  entities who may be propitiated or scared away; but no cult can properly
  be said to exist. And, in this stage, theology is wholly independent of
  ethics. The moral code, such as is implied by public opinion, derives no
  sanction from the theological dogmas, and the influence of the spirits is
  supposed to be exerted out of mere caprice or malice.</p>

  <p>As a next stage, the fundamental fear of ghosts and the consequent
  desire to propitiate them acquire an organised ritual in simple forms of
  ancestor-worship, such as the Rev. Mr. Turner describes among the people
  of Tanna (<i>l.c.</i> p. 88); and this line of development may be
  followed out until it attains its acme in the State-theology of China and
  the Kami-theology<a name="NtA51" href="#Nt51"><sup>[51]</sup></a> of
  Japan. Each of these is essentially ancestor-worship, the ancestors being
  reckoned back through family groups of higher and higher order, sometimes
  with strict reference to the principle of agnation, as in old Rome; and,
  as in the latter, it is intimately bound up with the whole organisation
  of the State. There are no idols; inscribed tablets in China, and strips
  of paper lodged in a peculiar portable shrine in Japan, represent the
  souls of the deceased, or the special seats which they occupy when
  sacrifices are offered by their descendants. In Japan it is interesting
  to observe that a national <!-- Page 186 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page186"></a>{186}</span>Kami&mdash;Ten-zio-dai-zin&mdash;is
  worshipped as a sort of Jahveh by the nation in general, and (as Lippert
  has observed) it is singular that his special seat is a portable
  litter-like shrine, termed the Mikosi, in some sort analogous to the
  Israelitic ark. In China, the emperor is the representative of the
  primitive ancestors, and stands, as it were, between them and the supreme
  cosmic deities&mdash;Heaven and Earth&mdash;who are superadded to them,
  and who answer to the Tangaloa and the Maui of the Polynesians.</p>

  <p>Sciotheism, under the form of the deification of ancestral ghosts, in
  its most pronounced form, is therefore the chief element in the theology
  of a great moiety, possibly of more than half, of the human race. I think
  this must be taken to be a matter of fact&mdash;though various opinions
  may be held as to how this ancestor-worship came about. But, on the other
  hand, it is no less a matter of fact that there are very few people
  without additional gods, who cannot, with certainty, be accounted for as
  deified ancestors.</p>

  <p>With all respect for the distinguished authorities on the other side,
  I cannot find good reasons for accepting the theory that the cosmic
  deities&mdash;who are superadded to deified ancestors even in China; who
  are found all over Polynesia, in Tangaloa and Maui, and in old Peru, in
  the Sun&mdash;are the product either of the "search after the infinite,"
  or of mistakes arising out of the confusion of a great chief's name with
  the thing signified by the name. But, however this may be, I think it is
  again merely matter of fact that, among a large portion of <!-- Page 187
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page187"></a>{187}</span>mankind,
  ancestor-worship is more or less thrown into the background either by
  such cosmic deities, or by tribal gods of uncertain origin, who have been
  raised to eminence by the superiority in warfare, or otherwise, of their
  worshippers.</p>

  <p>Among certain nations, the polytheistic theology, thus constituted,
  has become modified by the selection of some one cosmic or tribal god, as
  the only god to whom worship is due on the part of that nation (though it
  is by no means denied that other nations have a right to worship other
  gods), and thus results a worship of one God&mdash;<i>monolatry</i>, as
  Wellhausen calls it&mdash;which is very different from genuine
  monotheism.<a name="NtA52" href="#Nt52"><sup>[52]</sup></a> In ancestral
  sciotheism, and in this <i>monolatry</i>, the ethical code, often of a
  very high order, comes into closer relation with the theological creed.
  Morality is taken under the patronage of the god or gods, who reward all
  morally good conduct and punish all morally evil conduct in this world or
  the next. At the same time, however, they are conceived to be thoroughly
  human, and they visit any shadow of disrespect to themselves, shown by
  disobedience to their commands, or by delay, or carelessness, in carrying
  them out, as severely as any breach of the moral laws. Piety means minute
  attention to the due performance of all sacred rites, and covers any
  number of lapses in morality, just as cruelty, treachery, murder, and
  adultery did not bar David's claim to the title of the man after God's
  own heart among the Israelites; crimes against men may be expiated, <!--
  Page 188 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page188"></a>{188}</span>but
  blasphemy against the gods is an unpardonable sin. Men forgive all
  injuries but those which touch their self-esteem; and they make their
  gods after their own likeness, in their own image make they them.</p>

  <p>&nbsp;</p>

  <p>It is in the category of monolatry that I conceive the theology of the
  old Israelites must be ranged. They were polytheists, in so far as they
  admitted the existence of other Elohim of divine rank beside Jahveh; they
  differed from ordinary polytheists, in so far as they believed that
  Jahveh was the supreme god and the one proper object of their own
  national worship. But it will doubtless be objected that I have been
  building up a fictitious Israelitic theology on the foundation of the
  recorded habits and customs of the people, when they had lapsed from the
  ordinances of their great lawgiver and prophet Moses, and that my
  conclusions may be good for the perverts to Canaanitish theology, but not
  for the true observers of the Sinaitic legislation. The answer to the
  objection is that&mdash;so far as I can form a judgment of that which is
  well ascertained in the history of Israel&mdash;there is very little
  ground for believing that we know much, either about the theological and
  social value of the influence of Moses, or about what happened during the
  wanderings in the Desert.</p>

  <p>The account of the Exodus and of the occurrences in the Sinaitic
  peninsula; in fact, all the history of Israel before the invasion of
  Canaan, is full of wonderful stories which may be true, in so far as they
  <!-- Page 189 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page189"></a>{189}</span>are conceivable occurrences, but which are
  certainly not probable, and which I, for one, decline to accept until
  evidence, which deserves that name, is offered of their historical truth.
  Up to this time I know of none.<a name="NtA53"
  href="#Nt53"><sup>[53]</sup></a> Furthermore, I see no answer to the
  argument that one has no right to pick out of an obviously unhistorical
  statement the assertions which happen to be probable and discard the
  rest. But it is also certain that a primitively veracious tradition may
  be smothered under subsequent mythical additions, and that one has no
  right to cast away the former along with the latter. Thus, perhaps the
  fairest way of stating the case may be as follows.</p>

  <p>There can be no <i>à priori</i> objection to the supposition that the
  Israelites were delivered from their Egyptian bondage by a leader called
  Moses, and that he exerted a great influence over their subsequent
  organisation in the desert. There is no reason to doubt that, during
  their residence in the land of Goshen, the Israelites knew nothing of
  Jahveh; but, as their own prophets declare (see Ezek. xx.), were
  polytheistic idolaters, sharing in the worst practices of their
  neighbours. As to their conduct in other respects, nothing is known. But
  it may fairly be suspected that their ethics were not of a higher order
  than those of Jacob their progenitor, in which case they might derive
  great profit from contact with Egyptian society, which held honesty and
  <!-- Page 190 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page190"></a>{190}</span>truthfulness in the highest esteem. Thanks
  to the Egyptologers, we now know, with all requisite certainty, the moral
  standard of that society in the time, and long before the time, of Moses.
  It can be determined from the scrolls buried with the mummified dead and
  from the inscriptions on the tombs and memorial statues of that age. For,
  though the lying of epitaphs is proverbial, so far as their subject is
  concerned, they give an unmistakable insight into that which the writers
  and the readers of them think praiseworthy.</p>

  <p>In the famous tombs at Beni Hassan there is a record of the life of
  Prince Nakht, who served Osertasen II., a Pharaoh of the twelfth dynasty,
  as governor of a province. The inscription speaks in his name: "I was a
  benevolent and kindly governor who loved his country.... Never was a
  little child distressed nor a widow ill-treated by me. I have never
  repelled a workman or hindered a shepherd. I gave alike to the widow and
  to the married woman, and have not preferred the great to the small in my
  gifts." And we have the high authority of the late Dr. Samuel Birch for
  the statement that the inscriptions of the twelfth dynasty abound in
  injunctions of a high ethical character. "To feed the hungry, give drink
  to the thirsty, clothe the naked, bury the dead, loyally serve the king,
  formed the first duty of a pious man and faithful subject."<a
  name="NtA54" href="#Nt54"><sup>[54]</sup></a> The people for whom these
  inscriptions embodied their ideal of praiseworthiness assuredly had no
  imperfect <!-- Page 191 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page191"></a>{191}</span>conception of either justice or mercy. But
  there is a document which gives still better evidence of the moral
  standard of the Egyptians. It is the "Book of the Dead," a sort of "Guide
  to Spiritland," the whole, or a part, of which was buried with the mummy
  of every well-to-do Egyptian, while extracts from it are found in
  innumerable inscriptions. Portions of this work are of extreme antiquity,
  evidence of their existence occurring as far back as the fifth and sixth
  dynasties; while the 125th chapter, which constitutes a sort of book by
  itself, and is known as the "Book of Redemption in the Hall of the two
  Truths," is frequently inscribed upon coffins and other monuments of the
  nineteenth dynasty (that under which, there is reason to believe, the
  Israelites were oppressed and the Exodus took place), and it occurs, more
  than once, in the famous tombs of the kings of this and the preceding
  dynasty at Thebes.<a name="NtA55" href="#Nt55"><sup>[55]</sup></a> This
  "Book of Redemption" is chiefly occupied by the so-called "negative
  confession" made to the forty-two Divine Judges, in which the soul of the
  dead denies that he has committed faults of various kinds. It is,
  therefore, obvious that the Egyptians conceived that their gods commanded
  them not to do the deeds which are here denied. The "Book of Redemption,"
  in fact, implies the existence in the mind of the Egyptians, if not in a
  formal writing, of a series of ordinances couched, like the majority of
  the ten <!-- Page 192 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page192"></a>{192}</span>commandments, in negative terms. And it is
  easy to prove the implied existence of a series which nearly answers to
  the "ten words." Of course a polytheistic and image-worshipping people,
  who observed a great many holy days, but no Sabbaths, could have nothing
  analogous to the first or the second and the fourth commandments of the
  Decalogue; but, answering to the third, is "I have not blasphemed;" to
  the fifth, "I have not reviled the face of the king or my father;" to the
  sixth, "I have not murdered;" to the seventh, "I have not committed
  adultery;" to the eighth, "I have not stolen," "I have not done fraud to
  man;" to the ninth, "I have not told falsehoods in the tribunal of
  truth," and, further, "I have not calumniated the slave to his master." I
  find nothing exactly similar to the tenth commandment; but that the
  inward disposition of mind was held to be of no less importance than the
  outward act is to be gathered from the praises of kindliness already
  cited and the cry of "I am pure," which is repeated by the soul on trial.
  Moreover, there is a minuteness of detail in the confession which shows
  no little delicacy of moral appreciation&mdash;"I have not privily done
  evil against mankind," "I have not afflicted men," "I have not withheld
  milk from the mouths of sucklings," "I have not been idle," "I have not
  played the hypocrite," "I have not told falsehoods," "I have not
  corrupted woman or man," "I have not caused fear," "I have not multiplied
  words in speaking."</p>

  <p>Would that the moral sense of the nineteenth <!-- Page 193 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page193"></a>{193}</span>century <span
  class="scac">A.D.</span> were as far advanced as that of the Egyptians in
  the nineteenth century <span class="scac">B.C.</span> in this last
  particular! What incalculable benefit to mankind would flow from strict
  observance of the commandment, "Thou shalt not multiply words in
  speaking!" Nothing is more remarkable than the stress which the old
  Egyptians, here and elsewhere, lay upon this and other kinds of
  truthfulness, as compared with the absence of any such requirement in the
  Israelitic Decalogue, in which only a specific kind of untruthfulness is
  forbidden.</p>

  <p>If, as the story runs, Moses was adopted by a princess of the royal
  house, and was instructed in all the wisdom of the Egyptians, it is
  surely incredible that he should not have been familiar, from his youth
  up, with the high moral code implied in the "Book of Redemption." It is
  surely impossible that he should have been less familiar with the
  complete legal system, and with the method of administration of justice,
  which, even in his time, had enabled the Egyptian people to hold
  together, as a complex social organisation, for a period far longer than
  the duration of old Roman society, from the building of the city to the
  death of the last Cæsar. Nor need we look to Moses alone for the
  influence of Egypt upon Israel. It is true that the Hebrew nomads who
  came into contact with the Egyptians of Osertasen, or of Ramses, stood in
  much the same relation to them, in point of culture, as a Germanic tribe
  did to the Romans of Tiberius or of Marcus Antoninus, or as Captain
  Cook's Omai did to the English of George the Third. But, <!-- Page 194
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page194"></a>{194}</span>at the same
  time, any difficulty of communication which might have arisen out of this
  circumstance was removed by the long pre-existing intercourse of other
  Semites, of every grade of civilisation, with the Egyptians. In
  Mesopotamia and elsewhere, as in Phenicia, Semitic people had attained to
  a social organisation as advanced as that of the Egyptians; Semites had
  conquered and occupied Lower Egypt for centuries. So extensively had
  Semitic influences penetrated Egypt that the Egyptian language, during
  the period of the nineteenth dynasty, is said by Brugsch to be as full of
  Semitisms as German is of Gallicisms; while Semitic deities had
  supplanted the Egyptian gods at Heliopolis and elsewhere. On the other
  hand, the Semites, as far as Phenicia, were extensively influenced by
  Egypt.</p>

  <p>It is generally admitted<a name="NtA56"
  href="#Nt56"><sup>[56]</sup></a> that Moses, Phinehas (and perhaps
  Aaron), are names of Egyptian origin, and there is excellent authority
  for the statement that the name <i>Abir</i>, which the Israelites gave to
  their golden calf, and which is also used to signify the strong, the
  heavenly, and even God,<a name="NtA57" href="#Nt57"><sup>[57]</sup></a>
  is simply the Egyptian Apis. Brugsch points out that the god Tum, or Tom,
  who was the special object of worship in the city of Pi-Tom, with which
  the Israelites were only too familiar, was called &#x100;nkh and the
  "great god," and had no image. &#x100;nkh means "He who lives," "the
  living one," a name the resemblance of which to the <!-- Page 195
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page195"></a>{195}</span>"I am that I
  am" of Exodus is unmistakable, whatever may be the value of the fact.
  Every discussion of Israelitic ritual seeks and finds the explanation of
  its details in the portable sacred chests, the altars, the priestly
  dress, the breastplate, the incense, and the sacrifices depicted on the
  monuments of Egypt. But it must be remembered that these signs of the
  influence of Egypt upon Israel are not necessarily evidence that such
  influence was exerted before the Exodus. It may have come much later,
  through the close connection of the Israel of David and Solomon, first
  with Phenicia and then with Egypt.</p>

  <p>If we suppose Moses to have been a man of the stamp of Calvin, there
  is no difficulty in conceiving that he may have constructed the substance
  of the ten words, and even of the Book of the Covenant, which curiously
  resembles parts of the Book of the Dead, from the foundation of Egyptian
  ethics and theology which had filtered through to the Israelites in
  general, or had been furnished specially to himself by his early
  education; just as the great Genevese reformer built up a puritanic
  social organisation on so much as remained of the ethics and theology of
  the Roman Church, after he had trimmed them to his liking.</p>

  <p>Thus, I repeat, I see no <i>à priori</i> objection to the assumption
  that Moses may have endeavoured to give his people a theologico-political
  organisation based on the ten commandments (though certainly not quite in
  their present form) and the Book of the Covenant, contained in our
  present book of Exodus. But <!-- Page 196 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page196"></a>{196}</span>whether there is such evidence as amounts
  to proof, or, I had better say, to probability, that even this much of
  the Pentateuch owes its origin to Moses is another matter. The mythical
  character of the accessories of the Sinaitic history is patent, and it
  would take a good deal more evidence than is afforded by the bare
  assertion of an unknown writer to justify the belief that the people who
  "saw the thunderings and the lightnings and the voice of the trumpet and
  the mountain smoking" (Exod. xx. 18); to whom Jahveh orders Moses to say,
  "Ye yourselves have seen that I have talked with you from heaven. Ye
  shall not make other gods with me; gods of silver and gods of gold ye
  shall not make unto you" (<i>ibid.</i> 22, 23), should, less than six
  weeks afterwards, have done the exact thing they were thus awfully
  forbidden to do. Nor is the credibility of the story increased by the
  statement that Aaron, the brother of Moses, the witness and fellow-worker
  of the miracles before Pharaoh, was their leader and the artificer of the
  idol. And yet, at the same time, Aaron was apparently so ignorant of
  wrongdoing that he made proclamation, "To-morrow shall be a feast to
  Jahveh," and the people proceeded to offer their burnt-offerings and
  peace-offerings, as if everything in their proceedings must be
  satisfactory to the Deity with whom they had just made a solemn covenant
  to abolish image-worship. It seems to me that, on a survey of all the
  facts of the case, only a very cautious and hypothetical judgment is
  justifiable. It may be that Moses profited by the opportunities afforded
  him of <!-- Page 197 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page197"></a>{197}</span>access to what was best in Egyptian
  society to become acquainted, not only with its advanced ethical and
  legal code, but with the more or less pantheistic unification of the
  Divine to which the speculations of the Egyptian thinkers, like those of
  all polytheistic philosophers, from Polynesia to Greece, tend; if indeed
  the theology of the period of the nineteenth dynasty was not, as some
  Egyptologists think, a modification of an earlier, more distinctly
  monotheistic doctrine of a long antecedent age. It took only half a dozen
  centuries for the theology of Paul to become the theology of Gregory the
  Great; and it is possible that twenty centuries lay between the theology
  of the first worshippers in the sanctuary of the Sphinx and that of the
  priests of Ramses Maimun.</p>

  <p>It may be that the ten commandments and the Book of the Covenant are
  based upon faithful traditions of the efforts of a great leader to raise
  his followers to his own level. For myself, as a matter of pious opinion,
  I like to think so; as I like to imagine that, between Moses and Samuel,
  there may have been many a seer, many a herdsman such as him of Tekoah,
  lonely amidst the hills of Ephraim and Judah, who cherished and kept
  alive these traditions. In the present results of Biblical criticism,
  however, I can discover no justification for the common assumption that,
  between the time of Joshua and that of Rehoboam, the Israelites were
  familiar with either the Deuteronomic or the Levitical legislation; or
  that the theology of the Israelites, from the king who sat on the throne
  to the lowest of his subjects, was in <!-- Page 198 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page198"></a>{198}</span>any important respect
  different from that which might naturally be expected from their previous
  history and the conditions of their existence. But there is excellent
  evidence to the contrary effect. And, for my part, I see no reason to
  doubt that, like the rest of the world, the Israelites had passed through
  a period of mere ghost-worship, and had advanced through Ancestor-worship
  and Fetishism and Totemism to the theological level at which we find them
  in the books of Judges and Samuel.</p>

  <p>&nbsp;</p>

  <p>All the more remarkable, therefore, is the extraordinary change which
  is to be noted in the eighth century <span class="scac">B.C.</span> The
  student who is familiar with the theology implied, or expressed, in the
  books of Judges, Samuel, and the first book of Kings, finds himself in a
  new world of thought, in the full tide of a great reformation, when he
  reads Joel, Amos, Hosea, Isaiah, Micah, and Jeremiah.</p>

  <p>The essence of this change is the reversal of the position which, in
  primitive society, ethics holds in relation to theology. Originally, that
  which men worship is a theological hypothesis, not a moral ideal. The
  prophets, in substance, if not always in form, preach the opposite
  doctrine. They are constantly striving to free the moral ideal from the
  stifling embrace of the current theology and its concomitant ritual.
  Theirs was not an intellectual criticism, argued on strictly scientific
  grounds; the image-worshippers and the believers in the efficacy of
  sacrifices and ceremonies might logically have held their <!-- Page 199
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page199"></a>{199}</span>own against
  anything the prophets have to say; it was an ethical criticism. From the
  height of his moral intuition&mdash;that the whole duty of man is to do
  justice and love mercy and to bear himself as humbly as befits his
  insignificance in face of the Infinite&mdash;the prophet simply laughs at
  the idolaters of stocks and stones and the idolaters of ritual. Idols of
  the first kind, in his experience, were inseparably united with the
  practice of immorality, and they were to be ruthlessly destroyed. As for
  sacrifices and ceremonies, whatever their intrinsic value might be, they
  might be tolerated on condition of ceasing to be idols; they might even
  be praiseworthy on condition of being made to subserve the worship of the
  true Jahveh&mdash;the moral ideal.</p>

  <p>If the realm of David had remained undivided, if the Assyrian and the
  Chaldean and the Egyptian had left Israel to the ordinary course of
  development of an Oriental kingdom, it is possible that the effects of
  the reforming zeal of the prophets of the eighth and seventh centuries
  might have been effaced by the growth, according to its inevitable
  tendencies, of the theology which they combated. But the captivity made
  the fortune of the ideas which it was the privilege of these men to
  launch upon an endless career. With the abolition of the Temple-services
  for more than half a century, the priest must have lost and the scribe
  gained influence. The puritanism of a vigorous minority among the
  Babylonian Jews rooted out polytheism from all its hiding-places in the
  theology which they had inherited; they created the first <!-- Page 200
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page200"></a>{200}</span>consistent,
  remorseless, naked monotheism, which, so far as history records, appeared
  in the world (for Zoroastrism is practically ditheism, and Buddhism
  any-theism or no-theism); and they inseparably united therewith an
  ethical code, which, for its purity and for its efficiency as a bond of
  social life, was and is, unsurpassed. So I think we must not judge Ezra
  and Nehemiah and their followers too hardly, if they exemplified the
  usual doom of poor humanity to escape from one error only to fall into
  another; if they failed to free themselves as completely from the
  idolatry of ritual as they had from that of images and dogmas; if they
  cherished the new fetters of the Levitical legislation which they had
  fitted upon themselves and their nation, as though such bonds had the
  sanctity of the obligations of morality; and if they led succeeding
  generations to spend their best energies in building that "hedge round
  the Torah" which was meant to preserve both ethics and theology, but
  which too often had the effect of pampering the latter and starving the
  former. The world being what it was, it is to be doubted whether Israel
  would have preserved intact the pure ore of religion, which the prophets
  had extracted for the use of mankind as well as for their nation, had not
  the leaders of the nation been zealous, even to death, for the dross of
  the law in which it was embedded. The struggle of the Jews, under the
  Maccabean house, against the Seleucidæ was as important for mankind as
  that of the Greeks against the Persians. And, of all the strange ironies
  of history, perhaps the strangest <!-- Page 201 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page201"></a>{201}</span>is that "Pharisee" is
  current, as a term of reproach, among the theological descendants of that
  sect of Nazarenes who, without the martyr spirit of those primitive
  Puritans, would never have come into existence. They, like their
  historical successors, our own Puritans, have shared the general fate of
  the poor wise men who save cities.</p>

  <p>A criticism of theology from the side of science is not thought of by
  the prophets, and is at most indicated in the books of Job and
  Ecclesiastes, in both of which the problem of vindicating the ways of God
  to man is given up, though on different grounds, as a hopeless one. But
  with the extensive introduction of Greek thought among the Jews, which
  took place, not only during the domination of the Seleucidæ in Palestine,
  but in the great Judaic colony which flourished in Egypt under the
  Ptolemies, criticism, on both ethical and scientific grounds, took a new
  departure.</p>

  <p>In the hands of the Alexandrian Jews, as represented by Philo, the
  fundamental axiom of later Jewish, as of Christian monotheism, that the
  Deity is infinitely perfect and infinitely good, worked itself out into
  its logical consequence&mdash;agnostic theism. Philo will allow of no
  point of contact between God and a world in which evil exists. For him
  God has no relation to space or to time, and, as infinite, suffers no
  predicate beyond that of existence. It is, therefore, absurd to ascribe
  to Him mental faculties and affections comparable in the remotest degree
  to those of men; He is in no way an object of cognition; He <!-- Page 202
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page202"></a>{202}</span>is <span
  title="apoios" class="grk"
  >&#x1F04;&pi;&omicron;&iota;&omicron;&sigmaf;</span> and <span
  title="akatalêktos" class="grk"
  >&#x1F00;&kappa;&alpha;&tau;&#x1F71;&lambda;&eta;&kappa;&tau;&omicron;&sigmaf;</span><a
  name="NtA58" href="#Nt58"><sup>[58]</sup></a>&mdash;without quality and
  incomprehensible. That is to say, the Alexandrian Jew of the first
  century had anticipated the reasonings of Hamilton and Mansell in the
  nineteenth, and, for him, God is the Unknowable in the sense in which
  that term is used by Mr. Herbert Spencer. Moreover, Philo's definition of
  the Supreme Being would not be inconsistent with that "substantia
  constans infinitis attributis, quorum unumquodque æternam et infinitam
  essentiam exprimit," given by another great Israelite, were it not that
  Spinoza's doctrine of the immanence of the Deity in the world puts him,
  at any rate formally, at the antipodes of theological speculation. But
  the conception of the essential incognoscibility of the Deity is the same
  in each case. However, Philo was too thorough an Israelite and too much
  the child of his time to be content with this agnostic position. With the
  help of the Platonic and Stoic philosophy, he constructed an
  apprehensible, if not comprehensible, quasi-deity out of the Logos; while
  other more or less personified divine powers, or attributes, bridged over
  the interval between God and man; between the sacred existence, too pure
  to be called by any name which implied a conceivable quality, and the
  gross and evil world of matter. In order to get over the ethical
  difficulties presented by the naïve naturalism of many parts of <!-- Page
  203 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page203"></a>{203}</span>those
  Scriptures, in the divine authority of which he firmly believed, Philo
  borrowed from the Stoics (who had been in like straits in respect of
  Greek mythology), that great Excalibur which they had forged with
  infinite pains and skill&mdash;the method of allegorical interpretation.
  This mighty "two-handed engine at the door" of the theologian is
  warranted to make a speedy end of any and every moral or intellectual
  difficulty, by showing that, taken allegorically or, as it is otherwise
  said, "poetically," or, "in a spiritual sense," the plainest words mean
  whatever a pious interpreter desires they should mean. In Biblical
  phrase, Zeno (who probably had a strain of Semitic blood in him) was the
  "father of all such as reconcile." No doubt Philo and his followers were
  eminently religious men; but they did endless injury to the cause of
  religion by laying the foundations of a new theology, while equipping the
  defenders of it with the subtlest of all weapons of offence and defence,
  and with an inexhaustible store of sophistical arguments of the most
  plausible aspect.</p>

  <p>The question of the real bearing upon theology of the influence
  exerted by the teaching of Philo's contemporary, Jesus of Nazareth, is
  one upon which it is not germane to my present purpose to enter. I take
  it simply as an unquestionable fact that his immediate disciples, known
  to their countrymen as "Nazarenes," were regarded as, and considered
  themselves to be, perfectly orthodox Jews belonging to the puritanic or
  pharisaic section of their people, and differing from the rest only in
  their belief that <!-- Page 204 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page204"></a>{204}</span>the Messiah had already come.
  Christianity, it is said, first became clearly differentiated at Antioch,
  and it separated itself from orthodox Judaism by denying the obligation
  of the rite of circumcision and of the food prohibitions, prescribed by
  the law. Henceforward theology became relatively stationary among the
  Jews,<a name="NtA59" href="#Nt59"><sup>[59]</sup></a> and the history of
  its rapid progress in a new course of evolution is the history of the
  Christian Churches, orthodox and heterodox. The steps in this evolution
  are obvious. The first is the birth of a new theological scheme arising
  out of the union of elements derived from Greek philosophy with elements
  derived from Israelitic theology. In the fourth Gospel, the Logos, raised
  to a somewhat higher degree of personification than in the Alexandrian
  theosophy, is identified with Jesus of Nazareth. In the Epistles,
  especially the later of those attributed to Paul, the Israelitic ideas of
  the Messiah and of sacrificial atonement coalesce with one another and
  with the embodiment of the Logos in Jesus, until the apotheosis of the
  Son of man is almost, or quite, effected. The history of Christian dogma,
  from Justin to Athanasius, is a record of continual progress in the same
  direction, until the fair body of religion, revealed in almost naked
  purity by the prophets, is <!-- Page 205 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page205"></a>{205}</span>once more hidden under a new accumulation
  of dogmas and of ritual practices of which the primitive Nazarene knew
  nothing; and which he would probably have regarded as blasphemous if he
  could have been made to understand them.</p>

  <p>As, century after century, the ages roll on, polytheism comes back
  under the disguise of Mariolatry and the adoration of saints;
  image-worship becomes as rampant as in old Egypt; adoration of relics
  takes the place of the old fetish-worship; the virtues of the ephod pale
  before those of holy coats and handkerchiefs; shrines and calvaries make
  up for the loss of the ark and of the high places; and even the lustral
  fluid of paganism is replaced by holy water at the porches of the
  temples. A touching ceremony&mdash;the common meal originally eaten in
  pious memory of a loved teacher&mdash;was metamorphosed into a
  flesh-and-blood sacrifice, supposed to possess exactly that redeeming
  virtue which the prophets denied to the flesh-and-blood sacrifices of
  their day; while the minute observance of ritual was raised to a degree
  of punctilious refinement which Levitical legislators might envy. And
  with the growth of this theology, grew its inevitable concomitant, the
  belief in evil spirits, in possession, in sorcery, in charms and omens,
  until the Christians of the twelfth century after our era were sunk in
  more debased and brutal superstitions than are recorded of the Israelites
  in the twelfth century before it.</p>

  <p>The greatest men of the Middle Ages are unable to escape the
  infection. Dante's "Inferno" would be <!-- Page 206 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page206"></a>{206}</span>revolting if it were
  not so often sublime, so often exquisitely tender. The hideous pictures
  which cover a vast space on the south wall of the Campo Santo of Pisa
  convey information, as terrible as it is indisputable, of the theological
  conceptions of Dante's countrymen in the fourteenth century, whose eyes
  were addressed by the painters of those disgusting scenes, and whose
  approbation they knew how to win. A candid Mexican of the time of Cortez,
  could he have seen this Christian burial-place, would have taken it for
  an appropriately adorned Teocalli. The professed disciple of the God of
  justice and of mercy might there gloat over the sufferings of his
  fellow-men depicted as undergoing every extremity of atrocious and
  sanguinary torture to all eternity, for theological errors no less than
  for moral delinquencies; while, in the central figure of Satan,<a
  name="NtA60" href="#Nt60"><sup>[60]</sup></a> occupied in champing up
  souls in his capricious and well-toothed jaws, to void them again for the
  purpose of undergoing fresh suffering, we have the counterpart of the
  strange Polynesian and Egyptian dogma that there were certain gods who
  employed themselves in devouring the ghostly flesh of the spirits of the
  dead. <!-- Page 207 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page207"></a>{207}</span>But, in justice to the Polynesians, it
  must be recollected that, after three such operations, they thought the
  soul was purified and happy. In the view of the Christian theologian the
  operation was only a preparation for new tortures continued for ever and
  aye.</p>

  <p>With the growth of civilisation in Europe, and with the revival of
  letters and of science in the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries, the
  ethical and intellectual criticism of theology once more recommenced, and
  arrived at a temporary resting-place in the confessions of the various
  reformed Protestant sects in the sixteenth century; almost all of which,
  as soon as they were strong enough, began to persecute those who carried
  criticism beyond their own limit. But the movement was not arrested by
  these ecclesiastical barriers, as their constructors fondly imagined it
  would be; it was continued, tacitly or openly, by Galileo, by Hobbes, by
  Descartes, and especially by Spinoza, in the seventeenth century; by the
  English Freethinkers, by Rousseau, by the French Encyclopædists, and by
  the German Rationalists, among whom Lessing stands out a head and
  shoulders taller than the rest, throughout the eighteenth century; by the
  historians, the philologers, the Biblical critics, the geologists, and
  the biologists in the nineteenth century, until it is obvious to all who
  can see that the moral sense and the really scientific method of seeking
  for truth are once more predominating over false science. Once more
  ethics and theology are parting company.</p>

  <p>It is my conviction that, with the spread of true scientific culture,
  whatever may be the medium, <!-- Page 208 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page208"></a>{208}</span>historical, philological, philosophical,
  or physical, through which that culture is conveyed, and with its
  necessary concomitant, a constant elevation of the standard of veracity,
  the end of the evolution of theology will be like its beginning&mdash;it
  will cease to have any relation to ethics. I suppose that, so long as the
  human mind exists, it will not escape its deep-seated instinct to
  personify its intellectual conceptions. The science of the present day is
  as full of this particular form of intellectual shadow-worship as is the
  nescience of ignorant ages. The difference is that the philosopher who is
  worthy of the name knows that his personified hypotheses, such as law,
  and force, and ether, and the like, are merely useful symbols, while the
  ignorant and the careless take them for adequate expressions of reality.
  So, it may be, that the majority of mankind may find the practice of
  morality made easier by the use of theological symbols. And unless these
  are converted from symbols into idols, I do not see that science has
  anything to say to the practice, except to give an occasional warning of
  its dangers. But, when such symbols are dealt with as real existences, I
  think the highest duty which is laid upon men of science is to show that
  these dogmatic idols have no greater value than the fabrications of men's
  hands, the stocks and the stones, which they have replaced.</p>

<h3>SCIENCE AND MORALS</h3>

  <p>In spite of long and, perhaps, not unjustifiable hesitation, I begin
  to think that there must be something in telepathy. For evidence, which I
  may not disregard, is furnished by the last number of the <i>Fortnightly
  Review</i> that, among the hitherto undiscovered endowments of the human
  species, there may be a power even more wonderful than the mystic faculty
  by which the esoterically Buddhistic sage "upon the farthest mountain in
  Cathay" reads the inmost thoughts of a dweller within the homely circuit
  of the London postal district. Great indeed is the insight of such a
  seer; but how much greater is his who combines the feat of reading, not
  merely the thoughts of which the thinker is aware, but those of which he
  knows nothing; who sees him unconsciously drawing the conclusions which
  he repudiates, and supporting the doctrines which he detests. To reflect
  upon the confusion which the working of such a power as this may
  introduce into one's ideas of personality and responsibility is
  perilous&mdash;madness lies that way. But truth is truth, and I am almost
  fain to believe in <!-- Page 210 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page210"></a>{210}</span>this magical visibility of the
  non-existent when the only alternative is the supposition that the writer
  of the article on "Materialism and Morality" in vol. xl. (1886) of the
  <i>Fortnightly Review</i>, in spite of his manifest ability and honesty,
  has pledged himself, so far as I am concerned, to what, if I may trust my
  own knowledge of my own thoughts, must be called a multitude of errors of
  the first magnitude.</p>

  <p>I so much admire Mr. Lilly's outspokenness, I am so completely
  satisfied of the uprightness of his intentions, that it is repugnant to
  me to quarrel with anything he may say; and I sympathise so warmly with
  his manly scorn of the vileness of much that passes under the name of
  literature in these times, that I would willingly be silent under his by
  no means unkindly exposition of his theory of my own tenets, if I thought
  that such personal abnegation would serve the interest of the cause we
  both have at heart. But I cannot think so. My creed may be an
  ill-favoured thing, but it is mine own, as Touchstone says of his
  lady-love; and I have so high an opinion of the solid virtues of the
  object of my affections that I cannot calmly see her personated by a
  wench who is much uglier and has no virtue worth speaking of. I hope I
  should be ready to stand by a falling cause if I had ever adopted it; but
  suffering for a falling cause, which one has done one's best to bring to
  the ground, is a kind of martyrdom for which I have no taste. In my
  opinion, the philosophical theory which Mr. Lilly attributes to
  me&mdash;but which I have over and over again <!-- Page 211 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page211"></a>{211}</span>disclaimed&mdash;is
  untenable and destined to extinction; and I not unreasonably demur to
  being counted among its defenders.</p>

  <p>After the manner of a mediæval disputant, Mr. Lilly posts up three
  theses, which, as he conceives, embody the chief heresies propagated by
  the late Professor Clifford, Mr. Herbert Spencer, and myself. He says
  that we agree "(1) in putting aside, as unverifiable, everything which
  the senses cannot verify; (2) everything beyond the bounds of physical
  science; (3) everything which cannot be brought into a laboratory and
  dealt with chemically" (p. 578).</p>

  <p>My lamented young friend Clifford, sweetest of natures though keenest
  of disputants, is out of reach of our little controversies, but his works
  speak for him, and those who run may read a refutation of Mr. Lilly's
  assertions in them. Mr. Herbert Spencer, hitherto, has shown no lack
  either of ability or of inclination to speak for himself; and it would be
  a superfluity, not to say an impertinence, on my part, to take up the
  cudgels for him. But, for myself, if my knowledge of my own consciousness
  may be assumed to be adequate (and I make not the least pretension to
  acquaintance with what goes on in my "Unbewusstsein"), I may be permitted
  to observe that the first proposition appears to me to be not true; that
  the second is in the same case; and that, if there be gradations in
  untrueness, the third is so monstrously untrue that it hovers on the
  verge of absurdity, even if it does not actually flounder in that logical
  limbo. Thus, to all three theses, I reply in <!-- Page 212 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page212"></a>{212}</span>appropriate fashion,
  <i>Nego</i>&mdash;I say No; and I proceed to state the grounds of that
  negation, which the proprieties do not permit me to make quite so
  emphatic as I could desire.</p>

  <p>Let me begin with the first assertion, that I "put aside, as
  unverifiable, everything which the senses cannot verify." Can such a
  statement as this be seriously made in respect of any human being? But I
  am not appointed apologist for mankind in general; and confining my
  observations to myself, I beg leave to point out that, at this present
  moment, I entertain an unshakable conviction that Mr. Lilly is the victim
  of a patent and enormous misunderstanding, and that I have not the
  slightest intention of putting that conviction aside because I cannot
  "verify" it either by touch, or taste, or smell, or hearing, or sight,
  which (in the absence of any trace of telepathic faculty) make up the
  totality of my senses.</p>

  <p>Again, I may venture to admire the clear and vigorous English in which
  Mr. Lilly embodies his views; but the source of that admiration does not
  lie in anything which my five senses enable me to discover in the pages
  of his article, and of which an orang-outang might be just as acutely
  sensible. No, it lies in an appreciation of literary form and logical
  structure by æsthetic and intellectual faculties which are not senses,
  and which are not unfrequently sadly wanting where the senses are in full
  vigour. My poor relation may beat me in the matter of sensation; but I am
  quite confident that, when style and syllogisms are to be dealt with, he
  is nowhere. <!-- Page 213 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page213"></a>{213}</span></p>

  <p>If there is anything in the world which I do firmly believe in, it is
  the universal validity of the law of causation; but that universality
  cannot be proved by any amount of experience, let alone that which comes
  to us through the senses. And when an effort of volition changes the
  current of my thoughts, or when an idea calls up another associated idea,
  I have not the slightest doubt that the process to which the first of the
  phenomena, in each case, is due stands in the relation of cause to the
  second. Yet the attempt to verify this belief by sensation would be sheer
  lunacy. Now I am quite sure that Mr. Lilly does not doubt my sanity; and
  the only alternative seems to be the admission that his first proposition
  is erroneous.</p>

  <p>The second thesis charges me with putting aside "as unverifiable"
  "everything beyond the bounds of physical science." Again I say, No.
  Nobody, I imagine, will credit me with a desire to limit the empire of
  physical science, but I really feel bound to confess that a great many
  very familiar and, at the same time, extremely important phenomena lie
  quite beyond its legitimate limits. I cannot conceive, for example, how
  the phenomena of consciousness, as such and apart from the physical
  process by which they are called into existence, are to be brought within
  the bounds of physical science. Take the simplest possible example, the
  feeling of redness. Physical science tells us that it commonly arises as
  a consequence of molecular changes propagated from the eye to a certain
  part of the substance of the brain, when vibrations of the luminiferous
  ether of a certain character fall upon <!-- Page 214 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page214"></a>{214}</span>the retina. Let us
  suppose the process of physical analysis pushed so far that one could
  view the last link of this chain of molecules, watch their movements as
  if they were billiard balls, weigh them, measure them, and know all that
  is physically knowable about them. Well, even in that case, we should be
  just as far from being able to include the resulting phenomenon of
  consciousness, the feeling of redness, within the bounds of physical
  science, as we are at present. It would remain as unlike the phenomena we
  know under the names of matter and motion as it is now. If there is any
  plain truth upon which I have made it my business to insist over and over
  again it is this&mdash;and whether it is a truth or not, my insistence
  upon it leaves not a shadow of justification for Mr. Lilly's
  assertion.</p>

  <p>But I ask in this case also, how is it conceivable that any man, in
  possession of all his natural faculties, should hold such an opinion? I
  do not suppose that I am exceptionally endowed because I have all my life
  enjoyed a keen perception of the beauty offered us by nature and by art.
  Now physical science may and probably will, some day, enable our
  posterity to set forth the exact physical concomitants and conditions of
  the strange rapture of beauty. But if ever that day arrives, the rapture
  will remain, just as it is now, outside and beyond the physical world;
  and, even in the mental world, something superadded to mere sensation. I
  do not wish to crow unduly over my humble cousin the orang, but in the
  æsthetic province, as in that of the intellect, I am afraid he is <!--
  Page 215 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page215"></a>{215}</span>nowhere. I doubt not he would detect a
  fruit amidst a wilderness of leaves where I could see nothing; but I am
  tolerably confident that he has never been awestruck, as I have been, by
  the dim religious gloom, as of a temple devoted to the earthgods, of the
  tropical forest which he inhabits. Yet I doubt not that our poor
  long-armed and short-legged friend, as he sits meditatively munching his
  durian fruit, has something behind that sad Socratic face of his which is
  utterly "beyond the bounds of physical science." Physical science may
  know all about his clutching the fruit and munching it and digesting it,
  and how the physical titillation of his palate is transmitted to some
  microscopic cells of the gray matter of his brain. But the feelings of
  sweetness and of satisfaction which, for a moment, hang out their signal
  lights in his melancholy eyes, are as utterly outside the bounds of
  physics as is the "fine frenzy" of a human rhapsodist.</p>

  <p>Does Mr. Lilly really believe that, putting me aside, there is any man
  with the feeling of music in him who disbelieves in the reality of the
  delight which he derives from it, because that delight lies outside the
  bounds of physical science, not less than outside the region of the mere
  sense of hearing? But, it may be, that he includes music, painting, and
  sculpture under the head of physical science, and in that case I can only
  regret I am unable to follow him in his ennoblement of my favourite
  pursuits.</p>

  <p>The third thesis runs that I put aside "as unverifiable" "everything
  which cannot be brought into a <!-- Page 216 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page216"></a>{216}</span>laboratory and dealt with chemically;"
  and, once more, I say No. This wondrous allegation is no novelty; it has
  not unfrequently reached me from that region where gentle (or ungentle)
  dulness so often holds unchecked sway&mdash;the pulpit. But I marvel to
  find that a writer of Mr. Lilly's intelligence and good faith is willing
  to father such a wastrel. If I am to deal with the thing seriously, I
  find myself met by one of the two horns of a dilemma. Either some
  meaning, as unknown to usage as to the dictionaries, attaches to
  "laboratory" and "chemical," or the proposition is (what am I to say in
  my sore need for a gentle and yet appropriate
  word?)&mdash;well&mdash;unhistorical.</p>

  <p>Does Mr. Lilly suppose that I put aside "as unverifiable" all the
  truths of mathematics, of philology, of history? And if I do not, will he
  have the great goodness to say how the binomial theorem is to be dealt
  with "chemically," even in the best appointed "laboratory"; or where the
  balances and crucibles are kept by which the various theories of the
  nature of the Basque language may be tested; or what reagents will
  extract the truth from any given History of Rome, and leave the errors
  behind as a residual calx?</p>

  <p>I really cannot answer these questions, and unless Mr. Lilly can, I
  think he would do well hereafter to think more than twice before
  attributing such preposterous notions to his fellow-men, who, after all,
  as a learned counsel said, are vertebrated animals.</p>

  <p>The whole thing perplexes me much; and I am <!-- Page 217 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page217"></a>{217}</span>sure there must be an
  explanation which will leave Mr. Lilly's reputation for common sense and
  fair dealing untouched. Can it be&mdash;I put this forward quite
  tentatively&mdash;that Mr. Lilly is the victim of a confusion, common
  enough among thoughtless people, and into which he has fallen unawares?
  Obviously, it is one thing to say that the logical methods of physical
  science are of universal applicability, and quite another to affirm that
  all subjects of thought lie within the province of physical science. I
  have often declared my conviction that there is only one method by which
  intellectual truth can be reached, whether the subject-matter of
  investigation belongs to the world of physics or to the world of
  consciousness; and one of the arguments in favour of the use of physical
  science as an instrument of education which I have oftenest used is that,
  in my opinion, it exercises young minds in the appreciation of inductive
  evidence better than any other study. But while I repeat my conviction
  that the physical sciences probably furnish the best and most easily
  appreciable illustrations of the one and indivisible mode of ascertaining
  truth by the use of reason, I beg leave to add that I have never thought
  of suggesting that other branches of knowledge may not afford the same
  discipline; and assuredly I have never given the slightest ground for the
  attribution to me of the ridiculous contention that there is nothing true
  outside the bounds of physical science. Doubtless people who wanted to
  say something damaging, without too nice a regard to its truth or
  falsehood, have often enough misrepresented <!-- Page 218 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page218"></a>{218}</span>my plain meaning. But
  Mr. Lilly is not one of these folks at whom one looks and passes by, and
  I can but sorrowfully wonder at finding him in such company.</p>

  <p>So much for the three theses which Mr. Lilly has nailed on to a page
  of this Review. I think I have shown that the first is inaccurate, that
  the second is inaccurate, and that the third is inaccurate; and that
  these three inaccurates constitute one prodigious, though I doubt not
  unintentional, misrepresentation. If Mr. Lilly and I were dialectic
  gladiators, fighting in the arena of the <i>Fortnightly</i>, under the
  eye of an editorial lanista, for the delectation of the public, my best
  tactics would now be to leave the field of battle. For the question
  whether I do, or do not, hold certain opinions is a matter of fact, with
  regard to which my evidence is likely to be regarded as
  conclusive&mdash;at least until such time as the telepathy of the
  unconscious is more generally recognised.</p>

  <p>However, some other assertions are made by Mr. Lilly which more or
  less involve matters of opinion whereof the rights and wrongs are less
  easily settled, but in respect of which he seems to me to err quite as
  seriously as about the topics we have been hitherto discussing. And the
  importance of these subjects leads me to venture upon saying something
  about them, even though I am thereby compelled to leave the safe ground
  of personal knowledge.</p>

  <p>Before launching the three torpedoes which have so sadly exploded on
  board his own ship, Mr. Lilly says that with whatever "rhetorical
  ornaments I may <!-- Page 219 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page219"></a>{219}</span>gild my teaching," it is "Materialism."
  Let me observe, in passing, that rhetorical ornament is not in my way,
  and that gilding refined gold would, to my mind, be less objectionable
  than varnishing the fair face of truth with that pestilent cosmetic,
  rhetoric. If I believed that I had any claim to the title of
  "Materialist," as that term is understood in the language of philosophy
  and not in that of abuse, I should not attempt to hide it by any sort of
  gilding. I have not found reason to care much for hard names in the
  course of the last thirty years, and I am too old to develop a new
  sensitiveness. But, to repeat what I have more than once taken pains to
  say in the most unadorned of plain language, I repudiate, as
  philosophical error, the doctrine of Materialism as I understand it, just
  as I repudiate the doctrine of Spiritualism as Mr. Lilly presents it, and
  my reason for thus doing is, in both cases, the same; namely, that,
  whatever their differences, Materialists and Spiritualists agree in
  making very positive assertions about matters of which I am certain I
  know nothing, and about which I believe they are, in truth, just as
  ignorant. And further, that, even when their assertions are confined to
  topics which lie within the range of my faculties, they often appear to
  me to be in the wrong. And there is yet another reason for objecting to
  be identified with either of these sects; and that is that each is
  extremely fond of attributing to the other, by way of reproach,
  conclusions which are the property of neither, though they infallibly
  flow from the logical <!-- Page 220 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page220"></a>{220}</span>development of the first principles of
  both. Surely a prudent man is not to be reproached because he keeps clear
  of the squabbles of these philosophical Bianchi and Neri, by refusing to
  have anything to do with either?</p>

  <p>I understand the main tenet of Materialism to be that there is nothing
  in the universe but matter and force; and that all the phenomena of
  nature are explicable by deduction from the properties assignable to
  these two primitive factors. That great champion of Materialism whom Mr.
  Lilly appears to consider to be an authority in physical science, Dr.
  Büchner, embodies this article of faith on his title-page. <i>Kraft und
  Stoff</i>&mdash;force and matter&mdash;are paraded as the Alpha and Omega
  of existence. This I apprehend is the fundamental article of the faith
  materialistic; and whosoever does not hold it is condemned by the more
  zealous of the persuasion (as I have some reason to know) to the Inferno
  appointed for fools or hypocrites. But all this I heartily disbelieve;
  and at the risk of being charged with wearisome repetition of an old
  story, I will briefly give my reasons for persisting in my infidelity. In
  the first place, as I have already hinted, it seems to me pretty plain
  that there is a third thing in the universe, to wit, consciousness,
  which, in the hardness of my heart or head, I cannot see to be matter or
  force, or any conceivable modification of either, however intimately the
  manifestations of the phenomena of consciousness may be connected with
  the phenomena known as matter and force. In the second place, <!-- Page
  221 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page221"></a>{221}</span>the
  arguments used by Descartes and Berkeley to show that our certain
  knowledge does not extend beyond our states of consciousness, appear to
  me to be as irrefragable now as they did when I first became acquainted
  with them some half century ago. All the materialistic writers I know of
  who have tried to bite that file have simply broken their teeth. But, if
  this is true, our one certainty is the existence of the mental world, and
  that of <i>Kraft und Stoff</i> falls into the rank of, at best, a highly
  probable hypothesis.</p>

  <p>Thirdly, when I was a mere boy, with a perverse tendency to think when
  I ought to have been playing, my mind was greatly exercised by this
  formidable problem, What would become of things if they lost their
  qualities? As the qualities had no objective existence, and the thing
  without qualities was nothing, the solid world seemed whittled
  away&mdash;to my great horror. As I grew older, and learned to use the
  terms matter and force, the boyish problem was revived, <i>mutato
  nomine</i>. On the one hand, the notion of matter without force seemed to
  resolve the world into a set of geometrical ghosts, too dead even to
  jabber. On the other hand, Boscovich's hypothesis, by which matter was
  resolved into centres of force, was very attractive. But when one tried
  to think it out, what in the world became of force considered as an
  objective entity? Force, even the most materialistic of philosophers will
  agree with the most idealistic, is nothing but a name for the cause of
  motion. And if, with Boscovich, I resolved <!-- Page 222 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page222"></a>{222}</span>things into centres of
  force, then matter vanished altogether and left immaterial entities in
  its place. One might as well frankly accept Idealism and have done with
  it.</p>

  <p>I must make a confession, even if it be humiliating. I have never been
  able to form the slightest conception of those "forces" which the
  Materialists talk about, as if they had samples of them many years in
  bottle. They tell me that matter consists of atoms, which are separated
  by mere space devoid of contents; and that, through this void, radiate
  the attractive and repulsive forces whereby the atoms affect one another.
  If anybody can clearly conceive the nature of these things which not only
  exist in nothingness, but pull and push there with great vigour, I envy
  him for the possession of an intellect of larger grasp, not only than
  mine, but than that of Leibnitz or of Newton.<a name="NtA61"
  href="#Nt61"><sup>[61]</sup></a> To me the "chimæra, bombinans in vacuo
  quia comedit secundas intentiones" of the schoolmen is a familiar and
  domestic creature compared with such "forces." Besides, by the
  hypothesis, the forces are not matter; and thus all that is of any
  particular consequence in the world turns out to be not matter on the
  Materialist's own showing. Let it not be supposed that I am casting <!--
  Page 223 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page223"></a>{223}</span>a
  doubt upon the propriety of the employment of the terms "atom" and
  "force," as they stand among the working hypotheses of physical science.
  As formulæ which can be applied, with perfect precision and great
  convenience, in the interpretation of nature, their value is
  incalculable; but, as real entities, having an objective existence, an
  indivisible particle which nevertheless occupies space is surely
  inconceivable; and with respect to the operation of that atom, where it
  is not, by the aid of a "force" resident in nothingness, I am as little
  able to imagine it as I fancy any one else is.</p>

  <p>Unless and until anybody will resolve all these doubts and
  difficulties for me, I think I have a right to hold aloof from
  Materialism. As to Spiritualism, it lands me in even greater difficulties
  when I want to get change for its notes-of-hand in the solid coin of
  reality. For the assumed substantial entity, spirit, which is supposed to
  underlie the phenomena of consciousness, as matter underlies those of
  physical nature, leaves not even a geometrical ghost when these phenomena
  are abstracted. And, even if we suppose the existence of such an entity
  apart from qualities&mdash;that is to say, a bare existence&mdash;for
  mind; how does anybody know that it differs from that other entity, apart
  from qualities, which is the supposed substratum of matter? Spiritualism
  is, after all, little better than Materialism turned upside down. And if
  I try to think of the "spirit" which a man, by this hypothesis, carries
  about under his hat, as something devoid of relation to space, and as
  something indivisible, even <!-- Page 224 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page224"></a>{224}</span>in thought, while it is, at the same time,
  supposed to be in that place and to be possessed of half a dozen
  different faculties, I confess I get quite lost.</p>

  <p>As I have said elsewhere, if I were forced to choose between
  Materialism and Idealism, I should elect for the latter; and I certainly
  would have nothing to do with the effete mythology of Spiritualism. But I
  am not aware that I am under any compulsion to choose either the one or
  the other. I have always entertained a strong suspicion that the sage who
  maintained that man is the measure of the universe was sadly in the
  wrong; and age and experience have not weakened that conviction. In
  following these lines of speculation I am reminded of the quarter-deck
  walks of my youth. In taking that form of exercise you may perambulate
  through all points of the compass with perfect safety, so long as you
  keep within certain limits: forget those limits, in your ardour, and mere
  smothering and spluttering, if not worse, await you. I stick by the deck
  and throw a life-buoy now and then to the struggling folk who have gone
  overboard; and all I get for my humanity is the abuse of all whenever
  they leave off abusing one another.</p>

  <p>Tolerably early in life I discovered that one of the unpardonable
  sins, in the eyes of most people, is for a man to presume to go about
  unlabelled. The world regards such a person as the police do an unmuzzled
  dog, not under proper control. I could find no label that would suit me,
  so, in my desire to range myself and be respectable, I invented one; and,
  as the chief thing I was sure of was that I did not know a great <!--
  Page 225 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page225"></a>{225}</span>many
  things that the -ists and the -ites about me professed to be familiar
  with, I called myself an Agnostic. Surely no denomination could be more
  modest or more appropriate; and I cannot imagine why I should be every
  now and then haled out of my refuge and declared sometimes to be a
  Materialist, sometimes an Atheist, sometimes a Positivist; and sometimes,
  alas and alack, a cowardly or reactionary Obscurantist.</p>

  <p>I trust that I have, at last, made my case clear, and that henceforth
  I shall be allowed to rest in peace&mdash;at least, after a further
  explanation or two, which Mr. Lilly proves to me may be necessary. It has
  been seen that my excellent critic has original ideas respecting the
  meaning of the words "laboratory" and "chemical"; and, as it appears to
  me, his definition of "Materialist" is quite as much peculiar to himself.
  For, unless I misunderstand him, and I have taken pains not to do so, he
  puts me down as a Materialist (over and above the grounds which I have
  shown to have no foundation); firstly, because I have said that
  consciousness is a function of the brain; and, secondly, because I hold
  by determinism. With respect to the first point, I am not aware that
  there is any one who doubts that, in the proper physiological sense of
  the word function, consciousness, in certain forms at any rate, is a
  cerebral function. In physiology we call function that effect, or series
  of effects, which results from the activity of an organ. Thus, it is the
  function of muscle to give rise to motion; and the muscle gives rise to
  motion when the nerve which <!-- Page 226 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page226"></a>{226}</span>supplies it is stimulated. If one of the
  nerve-bundles in a man's arm is laid bare and a stimulus is applied to
  certain of the nervous filaments, the result will be production of motion
  in that arm. If others are stimulated, the result will be the production
  of the state of consciousness called pain. Now, if I trace these last
  nerve-filaments, I find them to be ultimately connected with part of the
  substance of the brain, just as the others turn out to be connected with
  muscular substance. If the production of motion in the one case is
  properly said to be the function of the muscular substance, why is the
  production of a state of consciousness in the other case not to be called
  a function of the cerebral substance? Once upon a time, it is true, it
  was supposed that a certain "animal spirit" resided in muscle and was the
  real active agent. But we have done with that wholly superfluous fiction
  so far as the muscular organs are concerned. Why are we to retain a
  corresponding fiction for the nervous organs?</p>

  <p>If it is replied that no physiologist, however spiritual his leanings,
  dreams of supposing that simple sensations require a "spirit" for their
  production, then I must point out that we are all agreed that
  consciousness is a function of matter, and that particular tenet must be
  given up as a mark of Materialism. Any further argument will turn upon
  the question, not whether consciousness is a function of the brain, but
  whether all forms of consciousness are so. Again, I hold it would be
  quite correct to say that material changes are the causes of psychical
  <!-- Page 227 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page227"></a>{227}</span>phenomena (and, as a consequence, that the
  organs in which these changes take place have the production of such
  phenomena for their function), even if the spiritualistic hypothesis had
  any foundation. For nobody hesitates to say that an event A is the cause
  of an event Z, even if there are as many intermediate terms, known and
  unknown, in the chain of causation as there are letters between A and Z.
  The man who pulls the trigger of a loaded pistol placed close to
  another's head certainly is the cause of that other's death, though, in
  strictness, he "causes" nothing but the movement of the finger upon the
  trigger. And, in like manner, the molecular change which is brought about
  in a certain portion of the cerebral substance by the stimulation of a
  remote part of the body would be properly said to be the cause of the
  consequent feeling, whatever unknown terms were interposed between the
  physical agent and the actual psychical product. Therefore, unless
  Materialism has the monopoly of the right use of language, I see nothing
  materialistic in the phraseology which I have employed.</p>

  <p>The only remaining justification which Mr. Lilly offers for dubbing me
  a Materialist, <i>malgré moi</i>, arises out of a passage which he
  quotes, in which I say that the progress of science means the extension
  of the province of what we call matter and force, and the concomitant
  gradual banishment from all regions of human thought of what we call
  spirit and spontaneity. I hold that opinion now, if anything, more firmly
  than I did when I gave utterance to it a score of <!-- Page 228 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page228"></a>{228}</span>years ago, for it has
  been justified by subsequent events. But what that opinion has to do with
  Materialism I fail to discover. In my judgment, it is consistent with the
  most thorough-going Idealism, and the grounds of that judgment are really
  very plain and simple.</p>

  <p>The growth of science, not merely of physical science, but of all
  science, means the demonstration of order and natural causation among
  phenomena which had not previously been brought under those conceptions.
  Nobody who is acquainted with the progress of scientific thinking in
  every department of human knowledge, in the course of the last two
  centuries, will be disposed to deny that immense provinces have been
  added to the realm of science; or to doubt that the next two centuries
  will be witnesses of a vastly greater annexation. More particularly in
  the region of the physiology of the nervous system, is it justifiable to
  conclude from the progress that has been made in analysing the relations
  between material and psychical phenomena, that vast further advances will
  be made; and that, sooner or later, all the so-called spontaneous
  operations of the mind will have, not only their relations to one
  another, but their relations to physical phenomena, connected in natural
  series of causes and effects, strictly defined. In other words, while, at
  present, we know only the nearer moiety of the chain of causes and
  effects, by which the phenomena we call material give rise to those which
  we call mental; hereafter, we shall get to the further end of the series.
  <!-- Page 229 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page229"></a>{229}</span></p>

  <p>In my innocence, I have been in the habit of supposing that this is
  merely a statement of facts, and that the good Bishop Berkeley, if he
  were alive, would find such facts fit into his system without the least
  difficulty. That Mr. Lilly should play into the hands of his foes, by
  declaring that unmistakable facts make for them, is an exemplification of
  ways that are dark, quite unintelligible to me. Surely Mr. Lilly does not
  hold that the disbelief in spontaneity&mdash;which term, if it has any
  meaning at all, means uncaused action&mdash;is a mark of the beast
  Materialism? If so, he must be prepared to tackle many of the Cartesians
  (if not Descartes himself), Spinoza and Leibnitz among the philosophers,
  Augustine, Thomas Aquinas, Calvin and his followers among theologians, as
  Materialists&mdash;and that surely is a sufficient <i>reductio ad
  absurdum</i> of such a classification.</p>

  <p>The truth is, that in his zeal to paint "Materialism," in large
  letters, on everything he dislikes, Mr. Lilly forgets a very important
  fact, which, however, must be patent to every one who has paid attention
  to the history of human thought; and that fact is, that every one of the
  speculative difficulties which beset Kant's three problems, the existence
  of a Deity, the freedom of the will, and immortality, existed ages before
  anything that can be called physical science, and would continue to exist
  if modern physical science were swept away. All that physical science has
  done has been to make, as it were, visible and tangible some difficulties
  that formerly were more hard of apprehension. Moreover, these
  difficulties <!-- Page 230 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page230"></a>{230}</span>exist just as much on the hypothesis of
  Idealism as on that of Materialism.</p>

  <p>The student of nature, who starts from the axiom of the universality
  of the law of causation, cannot refuse to admit an eternal existence; if
  he admits the conservation of energy, he cannot deny the possibility of
  an eternal energy; if he admits the existence of immaterial phenomena in
  the form of consciousness, he must admit the possibility, at any rate, of
  an eternal series of such phenomena; and, if his studies have not been
  barren of the best fruit of the investigation of nature, he will have
  enough sense to see that when Spinoza says, "Per Deum intelligo ens
  absolute infinitum, hoc est substantiam constantem infinitis attributis,"
  the God so conceived is one that only a very great fool would deny, even
  in his heart. Physical science is as little Atheistic as it is
  Materialistic.</p>

  <p>So with respect to immortality. As physical science states this
  problem, it seems to stand thus: "Is there any means of knowing whether
  the series of states of consciousness, which has been <span
  class="correction" title="Original reads 'casually'.">causally</span>
  associated for threescore years and ten with the arrangement and
  movements of innumerable millions of successively different material
  molecules, can be continued, in like association, with some substance
  which has not the properties of matter and force?" As Kant said, on a
  like occasion, if anybody can answer that question, he is just the man I
  want to see. If he says that consciousness cannot exist, except in
  relation of cause and effect with certain organic <!-- Page 231 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page231"></a>{231}</span>molecules, I must ask
  how he knows that; and if he says it can, I must put the same question.
  And I am afraid that, like jesting Pilate, I shall not think it worth
  while (having but little time before me) to wait for an answer.</p>

  <p>Lastly, with respect to the old riddle of the freedom of the will. In
  the only sense in which the word freedom is intelligible to me&mdash;that
  is to say, the absence of any restraint upon doing what one likes within
  certain limits&mdash;physical science certainly gives no more ground for
  doubting it than the common sense of mankind does. And if physical
  science, in strengthening our belief in the universality of causation and
  abolishing chance as an absurdity, leads to the conclusions of
  determinism, it does no more than follow the track of consistent and
  logical thinkers in philosophy and in theology, before it existed or was
  thought of. Whoever accepts the universality of the law of causation as a
  dogma of philosophy, denies the existence of uncaused phenomena. And the
  essence of that which is improperly called the freewill doctrine is that
  occasionally, at any rate, human volition is self-caused, that is to say,
  not caused at all; for to cause oneself one must have anteceded
  oneself&mdash;which is, to say the least of it, difficult to imagine.</p>

  <p>Whoever accepts the existence of an omniscient Deity as a dogma of
  theology, affirms that the order of things is fixed from eternity to
  eternity; for the fore-knowledge of an occurrence means that the
  occurrence will certainly happen; and the certainty <!-- Page 232
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page232"></a>{232}</span>of an event
  happening is what is meant by its being fixed or fated.<a name="NtA62"
  href="#Nt62"><sup>[62]</sup></a></p>

  <p>Whoever asserts the existence of an omnipotent Deity, that he made and
  sustains all things, and is the <i>causa causarum</i>, cannot, without a
  contradiction in terms, assert that there is any cause independent of
  him; and it is a mere subterfuge to assert that the cause of all things
  can "permit" one of these things to be an independent cause.</p>

<p><!-- Page 233 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page233"></a>{233}</span></p>

  <p>Whoever asserts the combination of omniscience and omnipotence as
  attributes of the Deity, does implicitly assert predestination. For he
  who knowingly makes a thing and places it in circumstances the operation
  of which on that thing he is perfectly acquainted with, does predestine
  that thing to whatever fate may befall it.</p>

  <p>Thus, to come, at last, to the really important part of all this
  discussion, if the belief in a God is essential to morality, physical
  science offers no obstacle thereto; if the belief in immortality is
  essential to morality, physical science has no more to say against the
  probability of that doctrine than the most ordinary experience has, and
  it effectually closes the mouths of those who pretend to refute it by
  objections deduced from merely physical data. Finally, if the belief in
  the uncausedness of volition is essential to morality, the student of
  physical science has no more to say against that absurdity than the
  logical philosopher or theologian. Physical science, I repeat, did not
  invent determinism, and the deterministic doctrine would stand on just as
  firm a foundation as it does if there were no physical science. Let any
  one who doubts this read Jonathan Edwards, whose demonstrations are
  derived wholly from philosophy and theology.</p>

  <p>Thus, when Mr. Lilly, like another Solomon Eagle, goes about
  proclaiming "Woe to this wicked city," and denouncing physical science as
  the evil genius of modern days&mdash;mother of materialism, and fatalism,
  and all sorts of other condemnable isms&mdash;I <!-- Page 234 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page234"></a>{234}</span>venture to beg him to
  lay the blame on the right shoulders; or, at least, to put in the dock,
  along with Science, those sinful sisters of hers, Philosophy and
  Theology, who, being so much older, should have known better than the
  poor Cinderella of the schools and universities over which they have so
  long dominated. No doubt modern society is diseased enough; but then it
  does not differ from older civilisations in that respect. Societies of
  men are fermenting masses, and as beer has what the Germans call
  "Oberhefe" and "Unterhefe," so every society that has existed has had its
  scum at the top and its dregs at the bottom; but I doubt if any of the
  "ages of faith" had less scum or less dregs, or even showed a
  proportionally greater quantity of sound wholesome stuff in the vat. I
  think it would puzzle Mr. Lilly, or any one else, to adduce convincing
  evidence that, at any period of the world's history, there was a more
  widespread sense of social duty, or a greater sense of justice, or of the
  obligation of mutual help, than in this England of ours. Ah! but, says
  Mr. Lilly, these are all products of our Christian inheritance; when
  Christian dogmas vanish virtue will disappear too, and the ancestral ape
  and tiger will have full play. But there are a good many people who think
  it obvious that Christianity also inherited a good deal from Paganism and
  from Judaism; and that, if the Stoics and the Jews revoked their bequest,
  the moral property of Christianity would realise very little. And, if
  morality has survived the stripping off of several sets of clothes which
  have been found to fit badly, why <!-- Page 235 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page235"></a>{235}</span>should it not be able
  to get on very well in the light and handy garments which Science is
  ready to provide?</p>

  <p>But this by the way. If the diseases of society consist in the
  weakness of its faith in the existence of the God of the theologians, in
  a future state, and in uncaused volitions, the indication, as the doctors
  say, is to suppress Theology and Philosophy, whose bickerings about
  things of which they know nothing have been the prime cause and continual
  sustenance of that evil scepticism which is the Nemesis of meddling with
  the unknowable.</p>

  <p>Cinderella is modestly conscious of her ignorance of these high
  matters. She lights the fire, sweeps the house, and provides the dinner;
  and is rewarded by being told that she is a base creature, devoted to low
  and material interests. But in her garret she has fairy visions out of
  the ken of the pair of shrews who are quarrelling downstairs. She sees
  the order which pervades the seeming disorder of the world; the great
  drama of evolution, with its full share of pity and terror, but also with
  abundant goodness and beauty, unrolls itself before her eyes; and she
  learns, in her heart of hearts, the lesson, that the foundation of
  morality is to have done, once and for all, with lying; to give up
  pretending to believe that for which there is no evidence, and repeating
  unintelligible propositions about things beyond the possibilities of
  knowledge.</p>

  <p>She knows that the safety of morality lies neither in the adoption of
  this or that philosophical <!-- Page 236 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page236"></a>{236}</span>speculation, or this or that theological
  creed, but in a real and living belief in that fixed order of nature
  which sends social disorganisation upon the track of immorality, as
  surely as it sends physical disease after physical trespasses. And of
  that firm and lively faith it is her high mission to be the
  priestess.</p>

<h3>SCIENTIFIC AND PSEUDO-SCIENTIFIC REALISM</h3>

  <p>Next to undue precipitation in anticipating the results of pending
  investigations, the intellectual sin which is commonest and most hurtful
  to those who devote themselves to the increase of knowledge is the
  omission to profit by the experience of their predecessors recorded in
  the history of science and philosophy. It is true that, at the present
  day, there is more excuse than at any former time for such neglect. No
  small labour is needed to raise oneself to the level of the acquisitions
  already made; and able men, who have achieved thus much, know that, if
  they devote themselves body and soul to the increase of their store, and
  avoid looking back, with as much care as if the injunction laid on Lot
  and his family were binding upon them, such devotion is sure to be richly
  repaid by the joys of the discoverer and the solace of fame, if not by
  rewards of a less elevated character.</p>

  <p>So, following the advice of Francis Bacon, we refuse <i>inter mortuos
  quærere vivum</i>; we leave the past to bury its dead, and ignore our
  intellectual ancestry. Nor are we content with that. We follow the evil
  example set us, not only by Bacon but by <!-- Page 238 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page238"></a>{238}</span>almost all the men of
  the Renaissance, in pouring scorn upon the work of our immediate
  spiritual forefathers, the schoolmen of the middle ages. It is accepted
  as a truth which is indisputable, that, for seven or eight centuries, a
  long succession of able men&mdash;some of them of transcendent acuteness
  and encyclopædic knowledge&mdash;devoted laborious lives to the grave
  discussion of mere frivolities and the arduous pursuit of intellectual
  will-o'-the-wisps. To say nothing of a little modesty, a little impartial
  pondering over personal experience might suggest a doubt as to the
  adequacy of this short and easy method of dealing with a large chapter of
  the history of the human mind. Even an acquaintance with popular
  literature which had extended so far as to include that part of the
  contributions of Sam Slick which contains his weighty aphorism that
  "there is a great deal of human nature in all mankind," might raise a
  doubt whether, after all, the men of that epoch, who, take them all
  round, were endowed with wisdom and folly in much the same proportion as
  ourselves, were likely to display nothing better than the qualities of
  energetic idiots, when they devoted their faculties to the elucidation of
  problems which were to them, and indeed are to us, the most serious which
  life has to offer. Speaking for myself, the longer I live the more I am
  disposed to think that there is much less either of pure folly, or of
  pure wickedness, in the world than is commonly supposed. It may be
  doubted if any sane man ever said to himself, "Evil be thou my good," and
  I have never yet had the good fortune to meet with a perfect <!-- Page
  239 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page239"></a>{239}</span>fool. When
  I have brought to the inquiry the patience and long-suffering which
  become a scientific investigator, the most promising specimens have
  turned out to have a good deal to say for themselves from their own point
  of view. And, sometimes, calm reflection has taught the humiliating
  lesson, that their point of view was not so different from my own as I
  had fondly imagined. Comprehension is more than halfway to sympathy, here
  as elsewhere.</p>

  <p>If we turn our attention to scholastic philosophy in the frame of mind
  suggested by these prefatory remarks, it assumes a very different
  character from that which it bears in general estimation. No doubt it is
  surrounded by a dense thicket of thorny logomachies and obscured by the
  dust-clouds of a barbarous and perplexing terminology. But suppose that,
  undeterred by much grime and by many scratches, the explorer has toiled
  through this jungle, he comes to an open country which is amazingly like
  his dear native land. The hills which he has to climb, the ravines he has
  to avoid, look very much the same; there is the same infinite space
  above, and the same abyss of the unknown below; the means of travelling
  are the same, and the goal is the same.</p>

  <p>That goal for the schoolmen, as for us, is the settlement of the
  question how far the universe is the manifestation of a rational order;
  in other words, how far logical deduction from indisputable premisses
  will account for that which has happened and does happen. That was the
  object of scholasticism, and, so far as I am aware, the object of modern
  science may be <!-- Page 240 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page240"></a>{240}</span>expressed in the same terms. In pursuit of
  this end, modern science takes into account all the phenomena of the
  universe which are brought to our knowledge by observation or by
  experiment. It admits that there are two worlds to be considered, the one
  physical and the other psychical; and that though there is a most
  intimate relation and interconnection between the two, the bridge from
  one to the other has yet to be found; that their phenomena run, not in
  one series, but along two parallel lines.</p>

  <p>To the schoolmen the duality of the universe appeared under a
  different aspect. How this came about will not be intelligible unless we
  clearly apprehend the fact that they did really believe in dogmatic
  Christianity as it was formulated by the Roman Church. They did not give
  a mere dull assent to anything the Church told them on Sundays, and
  ignore her teachings for the rest of the week; but they lived and moved
  and had their being in that supersensible theological world which was
  created, or rather grew up, during the first four centuries of our
  reckoning, and which occupied their thoughts far more than the sensible
  world in which their earthly lot was cast.</p>

  <p>For the most part, we learn history from the colourless compendiums or
  partisan briefs of mere scholars, who have too little acquaintance with
  practical life, and too little insight into speculative problems, to
  understand that about which they write. In historical science, as in all
  sciences which have to do with concrete phenomena, laboratory practice is
  indispensable; and the laboratory practice of historical science is <!--
  Page 241 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page241"></a>{241}</span>afforded, on the one hand, by active
  social and political life, and, on the other, by the study of those
  tendencies and operations of the mind which embody themselves in
  philosophical and theological systems. Thucydides and Tacitus, and, to
  come nearer our own time, Hume and Grote, were men of affairs, and had
  acquired, by direct contact with social and political history in the
  making, the secret of understanding how such history is made. Our notions
  of the intellectual history of the middle ages are, unfortunately, too
  often derived from writers who have never seriously grappled with
  philosophical and theological problems: and hence that strange myth of a
  millennium of moonshine to which I have adverted.</p>

  <p>However, no very profound study of the works of contemporary writers
  who, without devoting themselves specially to theology or philosophy,
  were learned and enlightened&mdash;such men, for example, as Eginhard or
  Dante&mdash;is necessary to convince oneself that, for them, the world of
  the theologian was an ever-present and awful reality. From the centre of
  that world, the Divine Trinity, surrounded by a hierarchy of angels and
  saints, contemplated and governed the insignificant sensible world in
  which the inferior spirits of men, burdened with the debasement of their
  material embodiment and continually solicited to their perdition by a no
  less numerous and almost as powerful hierarchy of devils, were constantly
  struggling on the edge of the pit of everlasting damnation.<a
  name="NtA63" href="#Nt63"><sup>[63]</sup></a></p>

<p><!-- Page 242 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page242"></a>{242}</span></p>

  <p>The men of the middle ages believed that through the Scriptures, the
  traditions of the Fathers, and the authority of the Church, they were in
  possession of far more, and more trustworthy, information with respect to
  the nature and order of things in the theological world than they had in
  regard to the nature and order of things in the sensible world. And, if
  the two sources of information came into conflict, so much the worse for
  the sensible world, which, after all, was more or less under the dominion
  of Satan. Let us suppose that a telescope powerful enough to show us what
  is going on in the nebula of the sword of Orion, should reveal a world in
  which stones fell upwards, parallel lines met, and the fourth dimension
  of space was quite obvious. Men of science would have only two <!-- Page
  243 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page243"></a>{243}</span>alternatives before them. Either the
  terrestrial and the nebular facts must be brought into harmony by such
  feats of subtle sophistry as the human mind is always capable of
  performing when driven into a corner; or science must throw down its arms
  in despair, and commit suicide, either by the admission that the universe
  is, after all, irrational, inasmuch as that which is truth in one corner
  of it is absurdity in another, or by a declaration of incompetency.</p>

  <p>In the middle ages, the labours of those great men who endeavoured to
  reconcile the system of thought which started from the data of pure
  reason, with that which started from the data of Roman theology, produced
  the system of thought which is known as scholastic philosophy; the
  alternative of surrender and suicide is exemplified by Avicenna and his
  followers when they declared that that which is true in theology may be
  false in philosophy, and <i>vice versâ</i>; and by Sanchez in his famous
  defence of the thesis "<i>Quod nil scitur</i>."</p>

  <p>To those who deny the validity of one of the primary assumptions of
  the disputants&mdash;who decline, on the ground of the utter
  insufficiency of the evidence, to put faith in the reality of that other
  world, the geography and the inhabitants of which are so confidently
  described in the so-called<a name="NtA64"
  href="#Nt64"><sup>[64]</sup></a> Christianity of Catholicism&mdash;the
  long and bitter contest, which <!-- Page 244 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page244"></a>{244}</span>engaged the best intellects for so many
  centuries, may seem a terrible illustration of the wasteful way in which
  the struggle for existence is carried on in the world of thought, no less
  than in that of matter. But there is a more cheerful mode of looking at
  the history of scholasticism. It ground and sharpened the dialectic
  implements of our race as perhaps nothing but discussions, in the result
  of which men thought their eternal no less than their temporal interests
  were at stake, could have done. When a logical blunder may ensure
  combustion, not only in the next world but in this, the construction of
  syllogisms acquires a peculiar interest. Moreover, the schools kept the
  thinking faculty alive and active, when the disturbed state of civil
  life, the mephitic atmosphere engendered by the dominant ecclesiasticism,
  and the almost total neglect of natural knowledge, might well have
  stifled it. And, finally, it should be remembered that scholasticism
  really did thresh out pretty effectually certain problems which have
  presented themselves to mankind ever since they began to think, and
  which, I suppose, will present themselves so long as they continue to
  think. Consider, for example, the controversy of the Realists and the
  Nominalists, which was carried on with varying fortunes, and under
  various names, from the time of Scotus Erigena to the end of the
  scholastic period. Has it now a merely antiquarian interest? Has
  Nominalism, in any of its modifications, so completely won the day that
  Realism may be regarded as dead and buried without hope of resurrection?
  <!-- Page 245 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page245"></a>{245}</span>Many people seem to think so, but it
  appears to me that, without taking Catholic philosophy into
  consideration, one has not to look about far to find evidence that
  Realism is still to the fore, and indeed extremely lively.<a name="NtA65"
  href="#Nt65"><sup>[65]</sup></a></p>

  <p>&nbsp;</p>

  <p>The other day I happened to meet with a report of a sermon recently
  preached in St. Paul's Cathedral. From internal evidence I am inclined to
  think that the report is substantially correct. But as I have not the
  slightest intention of finding fault with the eminent theologian and
  eloquent preacher to whom the discourse is attributed, for employment of
  scientific language in a manner for which he could find only too many
  scientific precedents, the accuracy of the report in detail is not to the
  purpose. I may safely take it as the embodiment of views which are
  thought to be quite in accordance with science by many excellent,
  instructed, and intelligent people.</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>The preacher further contended that it was yet more difficult to
  realise that our earthly home would become the scene of a vast physical
  catastrophe. Imagination recoils from the idea that the <!-- Page 246
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page246"></a>{246}</span>course of
  nature&mdash;the phrase helps to disguise the truth&mdash;so unvarying
  and regular, the ordered sequence of movement and life, should suddenly
  cease. Imagination looks more reasonable when it assumes the air of
  scientific reason. Physical law, it says, will prevent the occurrence of
  catastrophes only anticipated by an apostle in an unscientific age. Might
  not there, however, be a suspension of a lower law by the intervention of
  a higher? Thus every time we lifted our arms we defied the laws of
  gravitation, and in railways and steamboats powerful laws were held in
  check by others. The flood and the destruction of Sodom and Gomorrah were
  brought about by the operations of existing laws, and may it not be that
  in His illimitable universe there are more important laws than those
  which surround our puny life&mdash;moral and not merely physical forces?
  Is it inconceivable that the day will come when these royal and ultimate
  laws shall wreck the natural order of things which seems so stable and so
  fair? Earthquakes were not things of remote antiquity, as an island off
  Italy, the Eastern Archipelago, Greece, and Chicago bore witness.... In
  presence of a great earthquake men feel how powerless they are, and their
  very knowledge adds to their weakness. The end of human probation, the
  final dissolution of organised society, and the destruction of man's home
  on the surface of the globe, were none of them violently contrary to our
  present experience, but only the extension of present facts. The
  presentiment of death was common; there were felt to be many things which
  threatened the existence of society; and as our globe was a ball of fire,
  at any moment the pent-up forces which surge and boil beneath our feet
  might be poured out (<i>Pall Mall Gazette</i>, December 6, 1886).</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>The preacher appears to entertain the notion that the occurrence of a
  "catastrophe"<a name="NtA66" href="#Nt66"><sup>[66]</sup></a> involves a
  breach of the present order of nature&mdash;that it is an event
  incompatible with the physical laws which at present <!-- Page 247
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page247"></a>{247}</span>obtain. He
  seems to be of opinion that "scientific reason" lends its authority to
  the imaginative supposition that physical law will prevent the occurrence
  of the "catastrophes" anticipated by an unscientific apostle.</p>

  <p>Scientific reason, like Homer, sometimes nods; but I am not aware that
  it has ever dreamed dreams of this sort. The fundamental axiom of
  scientific thought is that there is not, never has been, and never will
  be, any disorder in nature. The admission of the occurrence of any event
  which was not the logical consequence of the immediately antecedent
  events, according to these definite, ascertained, or unascertained rules
  which we call the "laws of nature," would be an act of self-destruction
  on the part of science.</p>

  <p>"Catastrophe" is a relative conception. For ourselves it means an
  event which brings about very terrible consequences to man, or impresses
  his mind by its magnitude relatively to him. But events which are quite
  in the natural order of things to us, may be frightful catastrophes to
  other sentient beings. Surely no interruption of the order of nature is
  involved if, in the course of descending through an Alpine pine-wood, I
  jump upon an anthill and in a moment wreck a whole city and destroy a
  hundred thousand of its inhabitants. To the ants the catastrophe is worse
  than the earthquake of Lisbon. To me it is the natural and necessary
  consequence of the laws of matter in motion. A redistribution of energy
  has taken place, which is perfectly in accordance with natural order,
  however unpleasant its effects may be to the ants. <!-- Page 248 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page248"></a>{248}</span></p>

  <p>Imagination, inspired by scientific reason, and not merely assuming
  the airs thereof, as it unfortunately too often does in the pulpit, so
  far from having any right to repudiate catastrophes and deny the
  possibility of the cessation of motion and life, easily finds
  justification for the exactly contrary course. Kant in his famous
  <i>Theory of the Heavens</i> declares the end of the world and its
  reduction to a formless condition to be a necessary consequence of the
  causes to which it owes its origin and continuance. And, as to
  catastrophes of prodigious magnitude and frequent occurrence, they were
  the favourite <i>asylum ignorantiæ</i> of geologists, not a quarter of a
  century ago. If modern geology is becoming more and more disinclined to
  call in catastrophes to its aid, it is not because of any <i>à priori</i>
  difficulty in reconciling the occurrence of such events with the
  universality of order, but because the <i>à posteriori</i> evidence of
  the occurrence of events of this character in past times has more or less
  completely broken down.</p>

  <p>It is, to say the least, highly probable that this earth is a mass of
  extremely hot matter, invested by a cooled crust, through which the hot
  interior still continues to cool, though with extreme slowness. It is no
  less probable that the faults and dislocations, the foldings and
  fractures, everywhere visible in the stratified crust, its large and slow
  movements through miles of elevation and depression, and its small and
  rapid movements which give rise to the innumerable perceived and
  unperceived earthquakes which are constantly occurring, are due to the
  <!-- Page 249 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page249"></a>{249}</span>shrinkage of the crust on its cooling and
  contracting nucleus.</p>

  <p>Without going beyond the range of fair scientific analogy, conditions
  are easily conceivable which should render the loss of heat far more
  rapid than it is at present; and such an occurrence would be just as much
  in accordance with ascertained laws of nature as the more rapid cooling
  of a redhot bar, when it is thrust into cold water, than when it remains
  in the air. But much more rapid cooling might entail a shifting and
  rearrangement of the parts of the crust of the earth on a scale of
  unprecedented magnitude, and bring about "catastrophes" to which the
  earthquake of Lisbon is but a trifle. It is conceivable that man and his
  works and all the higher forms of animal life should be utterly
  destroyed; that mountain regions should be converted into ocean depths
  and the floor of oceans raised into mountains; and the earth become a
  scene of horror which even the lurid fancy of the writer of the
  Apocalypse would fail to portray. And yet, to the eye of science, there
  would be no more disorder here than in the Sabbatical peace of a summer
  sea. Not a link in the chain of natural causes and effects would be
  broken, nowhere would there be the slightest indication of the
  "suspension of a lower law by a higher." If a sober scientific thinker is
  inclined to put little faith in the wild vaticinations of universal ruin
  which, in a less saintly person than the seer of Patmos, might seem to be
  dictated by the fury of a revengeful fanatic rather than by the spirit of
  the teacher who bid men love <!-- Page 250 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page250"></a>{250}</span>their enemies, it is not on the ground
  that they contradict scientific principles; but because the evidence of
  their scientific value does not fulfil the conditions on which weight is
  attached to evidence. The imagination which supposes that it does, simply
  does not "assume the air of scientific reason."</p>

  <p>I repeat that, if imagination is used within the limits laid down by
  science, disorder is unimaginable. If a being endowed with perfect
  intellectual and æsthetic faculties, but devoid of the capacity for
  suffering pain, either physical or moral, were to devote his utmost
  powers to the investigation of nature, the universe would seem to him to
  be a sort of kaleidoscope, in which, at every successive moment of time,
  a new arrangement of parts of exquisite beauty and symmetry would present
  itself; and each of them would show itself to be the logical consequence
  of the preceding arrangement, under the conditions which we call the laws
  of nature. Such a spectator might well be filled with that <i>Amor
  intellectualis Dei</i>, the beatific vision of the <i>vita
  contemplativa</i>, which some of the greatest thinkers of all ages,
  Aristotle, Aquinas, Spinoza, have regarded as the only conceivable
  eternal felicity; and the vision of illimitable suffering, as if
  sensitive beings were unregarded animalcules which had got between the
  bits of glass of the kaleidoscope, which mars the prospect to us poor
  mortals, in no wise alters the fact that order is lord of all, and
  disorder only a name for that part of the order which gives us pain.</p>

  <p>The other fallacious employment of the names of <!-- Page 251 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page251"></a>{251}</span>scientific conceptions
  which pervades the preacher's utterance, brings me back to the proper
  topic of the present paper. It is the use of the word "law" as if it
  denoted a thing&mdash;as if a "law of nature," as science understands it,
  were a being endowed with certain powers, in virtue of which the
  phenomena expressed by that law are brought about. The preacher asks,
  "Might not there be a suspension of a lower law by the intervention of a
  higher?" He tells us that every time we lift our arms we defy the law of
  gravitation. He asks whether some day certain "royal and ultimate laws"
  may not come and "wreck" those laws which are at present, it would
  appear, acting as nature's police. It is evident, from these expressions,
  that "laws," in the mind of the preacher, are entities having an
  objective existence in a graduated hierarchy. And it would appear that
  the "royal laws" are by no means to be regarded as constitutional
  royalties: at any moment, they may, like Eastern despots, descend in
  wrath among the middle-class and plebeian laws, which have hitherto done
  the drudgery of the world's work, and, to use phraseology not unknown in
  our seats of learning&mdash;"make hay" of their belongings. Or perhaps a
  still more familiar analogy has suggested this singular theory; and it is
  thought that high laws may "suspend" low laws, as a bishop may suspend a
  curate.</p>

  <p>Far be it from me to controvert these views, if any one likes to hold
  them. All I wish to remark is that such a conception of the nature of
  "laws" has nothing to do with modern science. It is scholastic <!-- Page
  252 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page252"></a>{252}</span>realism&mdash;realism as intense and
  unmitigated as that of Scotus Erigena a thousand years ago. The essence
  of such realism is that it maintains the objective existence of
  universals, or, as we call them nowadays, general propositions. It
  affirms, for example, that "man" is a real thing, apart from individual
  men, having its existence, not in the sensible, but in the intelligible
  world, and clothing itself with the accidents of sense to make the Jack
  and Tom and Harry whom we know. Strange as such a notion may appear to
  modern scientific thought, it really pervades ordinary language. There
  are few people who would, at once, hesitate to admit that colour, for
  example, exists apart from the mind which conceives the idea of colour.
  They hold it to be something which resides in the coloured object; and so
  far they are as much Realists as if they had sat at Plato's feet.
  Reflection on the facts of the case must, I imagine, convince every one
  that "colour" is&mdash;not a mere name, which was the extreme Nominalist
  position&mdash;but a name for that group of states of feeling which we
  call blue, red, yellow, and so on, and which we believe to be caused by
  luminiferous vibrations which have not the slightest resemblance to
  colour; while these again are set afoot by states of the body to which we
  ascribe colour, but which are equally devoid of likeness to colour.</p>

  <p>In the same way, a law of nature, in the scientific sense, is the
  product of a mental operation upon the facts of nature which come under
  our observation, and has no more existence outside the mind than <!--
  Page 253 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page253"></a>{253}</span>colour has. The law of gravitation is a
  statement of the manner in which experience shows that bodies, which are
  free to move, do, in fact, move towards one another. But the other facts
  of observation, that bodies are not always moving in this fashion, and
  sometimes move in a contrary direction, are implied in the words "free to
  move." If it is a law of nature that bodies tend to move towards one
  another in a certain way; it is another and no less true law of nature
  that, if bodies are not free to move as they tend to do, either in
  consequence of an obstacle, or of a contrary impulse from some other
  source of energy than that to which we give the name of gravitation, they
  either stop still, or go another way.</p>

  <p>Scientifically speaking, it is the acme of absurdity to talk of a man
  defying the law of gravitation when he lifts his arm. The general store
  of energy in the universe working through terrestrial matter is doubtless
  tending to bring the man's arm down; but the particular fraction of that
  energy which is working through certain of his nervous and muscular
  organs is tending to drive it up, and more energy being expended on the
  arm in the upward than in the downward direction, the arm goes up
  accordingly. But the law of gravitation is no more defied in this case
  than when a grocer throws so much sugar into the empty pan of his scales
  that the one which contains the weight kicks the beam.</p>

  <p>The tenacity of the wonderful fallacy that the laws of nature are
  agents, instead of being, as they really are, a mere record of
  experience, upon which we <!-- Page 254 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page254"></a>{254}</span>base our interpretations of that which
  does happen, and our anticipation of that which will happen, is an
  interesting psychological fact; and would be unintelligible if the
  tendency of the human mind towards realism were less strong.</p>

  <p>Even at the present day, and in the writings of men who would at once
  repudiate scholastic realism in any form, "law" is often inadvertently
  employed in the sense of cause, just as, in common life, a man will say
  that he is compelled by the law to do so and so, when, in point of fact,
  all he means is that the law orders him to do it, and tells him what will
  happen if he does not do it. We commonly hear of bodies falling to the
  ground by reason of the law of gravitation, whereas that law is simply
  the record of the fact that, according to all experience, they have so
  fallen (when free to move), and of the grounds of a reasonable
  expectation that they will so fall. If it should be worth anybody's while
  to seek for examples of such misuse of language on my own part, I am not
  at all sure he might not succeed, though I have usually been on my guard
  against such looseness of expression. If I am guilty, I do penance
  beforehand, and only hope that I may thereby deter others from committing
  the like fault. And I venture on this personal observation by way of
  showing that I have no wish to bear hardly on the preacher for falling
  into an error for which he might find good precedents. But it is one of
  those errors which, in the case of a person engaged in scientific
  pursuits, do little harm, because it is corrected as soon as its
  consequences <!-- Page 255 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page255"></a>{255}</span>become obvious; while those who know
  physical science only by name are, as has been seen, easily led to build
  a mighty fabric of unrealities on this fundamental fallacy. In fact, the
  habitual use of the word "law," in the sense of an active thing, is
  almost a mark of pseudo-science; it characterises the writings of those
  who have appropriated the forms of science without knowing anything of
  its substance.</p>

  <p>There are two classes of these people: those who are ready to believe
  in any miracle so long as it is guaranteed by ecclesiastical authority;
  and those who are ready to believe in any miracle so long as it has some
  different guarantee. The believers in what are ordinarily called
  miracles&mdash;those who accept the miraculous narratives which they are
  taught to think are essential elements of religious doctrine&mdash;are in
  the one category; the spirit-rappers, table-turners, and all the other
  devotees of the occult sciences of our day are in the other: and, if they
  disagree in most things they agree in this, namely, that they ascribe to
  science a dictum that is not scientific; and that they endeavour to upset
  the dictum thus foisted on science by a realistic argument which is
  equally unscientific.</p>

  <p>It is asserted, for example, that, on a particular occasion, water was
  turned into wine; and, on the other hand, it is asserted that a man or a
  woman "levitated" to the ceiling, floated about there, and finally sailed
  out by the window. And it is assumed that the pardonable scepticism, with
  which most scientific men receive these statements, is due to the <!--
  Page 256 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page256"></a>{256}</span>fact
  that they feel themselves justified in denying the possibility of any
  such metamorphosis of water or of any such levitation, because such
  events are contrary to the laws of nature. So the question of the
  preacher is triumphantly put: How do you know that there are not "higher"
  laws of nature than your chemical and physical laws, and that these
  higher laws may not intervene and "wreck" the latter?</p>

  <p>The plain answer to this question is, Why should anybody be called
  upon to say how he knows that which he does not know? You are assuming
  that laws are agents&mdash;efficient causes of that which
  happens&mdash;and that one law can interfere with another. To us, that
  assumption is as nonsensical as if you were to talk of a proposition of
  Euclid being the cause of the diagram which illustrates it, or of the
  integral calculus interfering with the rule of three. Your question
  really implies that we pretend to complete knowledge not only of all past
  and present phenomena, but of all that are possible in the future, and we
  leave all that sort of thing to the adepts of esoteric Buddhism. Our
  pretensions are infinitely more modest. We have succeeded in finding out
  the rules of action of a little bit of the universe; we call these rules
  "laws of nature," not because anybody knows whether they bind nature or
  not, but because we find it is obligatory on us to take them into
  account, both as actors under nature, and as interpreters of nature. We
  have any quantity of genuine miracles of our own, and if you will furnish
  us with as good evidence of your miracles as we have <!-- Page 257
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page257"></a>{257}</span>of ours, we
  shall be quite happy to accept them and to amend our expression of the
  laws of nature in accordance with the new facts.</p>

  <p>As to the particular cases adduced, we are so perfectly fair-minded as
  to be willing to help your case as far as we can. You are quite mistaken
  in supposing that anybody who is acquainted with the possibilities of
  physical science will undertake categorically to deny that water may be
  turned into wine. Many very competent judges are already inclined to
  think that the bodies, which we have hitherto called elementary, are
  really composite arrangements of the particles of a uniform primitive
  matter. Supposing that view to be correct, there would be no more
  theoretical difficulty about turning water into alcohol, ethereal and
  colouring matters, than there is, at this present moment, any practical
  difficulty in working other such miracles; as when we turn sugar into
  alcohol, carbonic acid, glycerine, and succinic acid; or transmute
  gas-refuse into perfumes rarer than musk and dyes richer than Tyrian
  purple. If the so-called "elements," oxygen and hydrogen, which compose
  water, are aggregates of the same ultimate particles, or physical units,
  as those which enter into the structure of the so-called element
  "carbon," it is obvious that alcohol and other substances, composed of
  carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen, may be produced by a rearrangement of some
  of the units of oxygen and hydrogen into the "element" carbon, and their
  synthesis with the rest of the oxygen and hydrogen. <!-- Page 258
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page258"></a>{258}</span></p>

  <p>Theoretically, therefore, we can have no sort of objection to your
  miracle. And our reply to the levitators is just the same. Why should not
  your friend "levitate"? Fish are said to rise and sink in the water by
  altering the volume of an internal air-receptacle; and there may be many
  ways science, as yet, knows nothing of, by which we, who live at the
  bottom of an ocean of air, may do the same thing. Dialectic gas and wind
  appear to be by no means wanting among you, and why should not long
  practice in pneumatic philosophy have resulted in the internal generation
  of something a thousand times rarer than hydrogen, by which, in
  accordance with the most ordinary natural laws, you would not only rise
  to the ceiling and float there in quasi-angelic posture, but perhaps, as
  one of your feminine adepts is said to have done, flit swifter than train
  or telegram to "still-vexed Bermoothes," and twit Ariel, if he happens to
  be there, for a sluggard? We have not the presumption to deny the
  possibility of anything you affirm; only, as our brethren are particular
  about evidence, do give us as much to go upon as may save us from being
  roared down by their inextinguishable laughter.</p>

  <p>Enough of the realism which clings about "laws." There are plenty of
  other exemplifications of its vitality in modern science, but I will cite
  only one of them.</p>

  <p>This is the conception of "vital force" which comes straight from the
  philosophy of Aristotle. It is a fundamental proposition of that
  philosophy that <!-- Page 259 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page259"></a>{259}</span>a natural object is composed of two
  constituents&mdash;the one its matter, conceived as inert or even, to a
  certain extent, opposed to orderly and purposive motion; the other its
  form, conceived as a quasi-spiritual something, containing or
  conditioning the actual activities of the body and the potentiality of
  its possible activities.</p>

  <p>I am disposed to think that the prominence of this conception in
  Aristotle's theory of things arose from the circumstance that he was, to
  begin with and throughout his life, devoted to biological studies. In
  fact it is a notion which must force itself upon the mind of any one who
  studies biological phenomena, without reference to general physics, as
  they now stand. Everybody who observes the obvious phenomena of the
  development of a seed into a tree, or of an egg into an animal, will note
  that a relatively formless mass of matter gradually grows, takes a
  definite shape and structure, and, finally, begins to perform actions
  which contribute towards a certain end, namely, the maintenance of the
  individual in the first place, and of the species in the second. Starting
  from the axiom that every event has a cause, we have here the <i>causa
  finalis</i> manifested in the last set of phenomena, the <i>causa
  materialis</i> and <i>formalis</i> in the first, while the existence of a
  <i>causa efficiens</i> within the seed or egg and its product, is a
  corollary from the phenomena of growth and metamorphosis, which proceed
  in unbroken succession and make up the life of the animal or plant.</p>

  <p>Thus, at starting, the egg or seed is matter having <!-- Page 260
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page260"></a>{260}</span>a "form" like
  all other material bodies. But this form has the peculiarity, in
  contradistinction to lower substantial "forms," that it is a power which
  constantly works towards an end by means of living organisation.</p>

  <p>So far as I know, Leibnitz is the only philosopher (at the same time a
  man of science, in the modern sense, of the first rank) who has noted
  that the modern conception of Force, as a sort of atmosphere enveloping
  the particles of bodies, and having potential or actual activity, is
  simply a new name for the Aristotelian Form.<a name="NtA67"
  href="#Nt67"><sup>[67]</sup></a> In modern biology, up till within quite
  recent times, the Aristotelian conception held undisputed sway; living
  matter was endowed with "vital force," and that accounted for everything.
  Whosoever was not satisfied with that explanation was treated to that
  very "plain argument"&mdash;"confound you eternally"&mdash;wherewith Lord
  Peter overcomes the doubts of his brothers in the <i>Tale of a Tub</i>.
  "Materialist" was the mildest term applied to him&mdash;fortunate if he
  escaped pelting with "infidel" and "atheist." There may be scientific Rip
  Van Winkles about, who still hold by vital force; but among those
  biologists who have not been asleep for the last quarter of a century
  "vital force" no longer figures in the vocabulary of science. It is a
  patent survival of realism; the generalisation from experience that all
  living bodies exhibit certain activities of a definite character is made
  the basis of the notion <!-- Page 261 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page261"></a>{261}</span>that every living body contains an entity,
  "vital force," which is assumed to be the cause of those activities.</p>

  <p>It is remarkable, in looking back, to notice to what an extent this
  and other survivals of scholastic realism arrested or, at any rate,
  impeded the application of sound scientific principles to the
  investigation of biological phenomena. When I was beginning to think
  about these matters, the scientific world was occasionally agitated by
  discussions respecting the nature of the "species" and "genera" of
  Naturalists, of a different order from the disputes of a later time. I
  think most were agreed that a "species" was something which existed
  objectively, somehow or other, and had been created by a Divine fiat. As
  to the objective reality of genera, there was a good deal of difference
  of opinion. On the other hand, there were a few who could see no
  objective reality in anything but individuals, and looked upon both
  species and genera as hypostatised universals. As for myself, I seem to
  have unconsciously emulated William of Occam, inasmuch as almost the
  first public discourse I ever ventured upon, dealt with "Animal
  Individuality," and its tendency was to fight the Nominalist battle even
  in that quarter.</p>

  <p>Realism appeared in still stranger forms at the time to which I refer.
  The community of plan which is observable in each great group of animals
  was hypostatised into a Platonic idea with the appropriate name of
  "archetype," and we were told, as a disciple of Philo-Judæus might have
  told us, that this realistic figment was "the archetypal light" by which
  Nature <!-- Page 262 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page262"></a>{262}</span>has been guided amidst the "wreck of
  worlds." So, again, another naturalist, who had no less earned a
  well-deserved reputation by his contributions to positive knowledge, put
  forward a theory of the production of living things which, as nearly as
  the increase of knowledge allowed, was a reproduction of the doctrine
  inculcated by the Jewish Cabbala.</p>

  <p>Annexing the archetype notion, and carrying it to its full logical
  consequence, the author of this theory conceived that the species of
  animals and plants were so many incarnations of the thoughts of
  God&mdash;material representations of Divine ideas&mdash;during the
  particular period of the world's history at which they existed. But,
  under the influence of the embryological and palæontological discoveries
  of modern times, which had already lent some scientific support to the
  revived ancient theories of cosmical evolution or emanation, the
  ingenious author of this speculation, while denying and repudiating the
  ordinary theory of evolution by successive modification of individuals,
  maintained and endeavoured to prove the occurrence of a progressive
  modification in the Divine ideas of successive epochs.</p>

  <p>On the foundation of a supposed elevation of organisation in the whole
  living population of any epoch as compared with that of its predecessor,
  and a supposed complete difference in species between the populations of
  any two epochs (neither of which suppositions has stood the test of
  further inquiry), the author of this speculation based his conclusion
  that the Creator had, so to speak, improved upon his thoughts as time
  went on; and that, as each such <!-- Page 263 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page263"></a>{263}</span>amended scheme of creation came up, the
  embodiment of the earlier divine thoughts was swept away by a universal
  catastrophe, and an incarnation of the improved ideas took its place.
  Only after the last such "wreck" thus brought about, did the embodiment
  of a divine thought, in the shape of the first man, make its appearance
  as the <i>ne plus ultra</i> of the cosmogonical process.</p>

  <p>I imagine that Louis Agassiz, the genial backwoodsman of the science
  of my young days, who did more to open out new tracks in the scientific
  forest than most men, would have been much surprised to learn that he was
  preaching the doctrine of the Cabbala, pure and simple. According to this
  modification of Neoplatonism by contact with Hebrew speculation, the
  divine essence is unknowable&mdash;without form or attribute; but the
  interval between it and the world of sense is filled by intelligible
  entities, which are nothing but the familiar hypostatised abstractions of
  the realists. These have emanated, like immense waves of light, from the
  divine centre, and, as ten consecutive zones of Sephiroth, form the
  universe. The farther away from the centre, the more the primitive light
  wanes, until the periphery ends in those mere negations, darkness and
  evil, which are the essence of matter. On this, the divine agency
  transmitted through the Sephiroth operates after the fashion of the
  Aristotelian forms, and, at first, produces the lowest of a series of
  worlds. After a certain duration the primitive world is demolished and
  its fragments used up in making a better; and <!-- Page 264 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page264"></a>{264}</span>this process is
  repeated, until at length a final world, with man for its crown and
  finish, makes its appearance. It is needless to trace the process of
  retrogressive metamorphosis by which, through the agency of the Messiah,
  the steps of the process of evolution here sketched are retraced.
  Sufficient has been said to prove that the extremest realism current in
  the philosophy of the thirteenth century can be fully matched by the
  speculations of our own time.</p>

<h3>VII</h3>

<h3>SCIENCE AND PSEUDO-SCIENCE</h3>

  <p>In the opening sentences of a contribution to the last number of this
  Review,<a name="NtA68" href="#Nt68"><sup>[68]</sup></a> the Duke of
  Argyll has favoured me with a lecture on the proprieties of controversy,
  to which I should be disposed to listen with more docility if his Grace's
  precepts appeared to me to be based upon rational principles, or if his
  example were more exemplary.</p>

  <p>With respect to the latter point, the Duke has thought fit to entitle
  his article "Professor Huxley on Canon Liddon," and thus forces into
  prominence an element of personality, which those who read the paper
  which is the object of the Duke's animadversions will observe I have
  endeavoured, most carefully, to avoid. My criticisms dealt with a report
  of a sermon, published in a newspaper, and thereby addressed to all the
  world. Whether that sermon was preached by A or B was not a matter of the
  smallest consequence; and I went out of my way to absolve the learned
  divine to whom the discourse was attributed, from the responsibility for
  statements which, for anything I knew to the contrary, might contain <!--
  Page 266 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page266"></a>{266}</span>imperfect, or inaccurate, representations
  of his views. The assertion that I had the wish or was beset by any
  "temptation to attack" Canon Liddon is simply contrary to fact.</p>

  <p>But suppose that if, instead of sedulously avoiding even the
  appearance of such attack, I had thought fit to take a different course;
  suppose that, after satisfying myself that the eminent clergyman whose
  name is paraded by the Duke of Argyll had really uttered the words
  attributed to him from the pulpit of St. Paul's, what right would any one
  have to find fault with my action on grounds either of justice,
  expediency, or good taste?</p>

  <p>Establishment has its duties as well as its rights. The clergy of a
  State Church enjoy many advantages over those of unprivileged and
  unendowed religious persuasions; but they lie under a correlative
  responsibility to the State, and to every member of the body politic. I
  am not aware that any sacredness attaches to sermons. If preachers stray
  beyond the doctrinal limits set by lay lawyers, the Privy Council will
  see to it; and, if they think fit to use their pulpits for the
  promulgation of literary, or historical, or scientific errors, it is not
  only the right, but the duty, of the humblest layman, who may happen to
  be better informed, to correct the evil effects of such perversion of the
  opportunities which the State affords them and such misuse of the
  authority which its support lends them. Whatever else it may claim to be,
  in its relations with the State, the Established Church is a branch of
  the Civil Service; and, for those who <!-- Page 267 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page267"></a>{267}</span>repudiate the
  ecclesiastical authority of the clergy, they are merely civil servants,
  as much responsible to the English people for the proper performance of
  their duties as any others.</p>

  <p>The Duke of Argyll tells us that the "work and calling" of the clergy
  prevent them from "pursuing disputation as others can." I wonder if his
  Grace ever reads the so-called religious newspapers. It is not an
  occupation which I should commend to any one who wishes to employ his
  time profitably; but a very short devotion to this exercise will suffice
  to convince him that the "pursuit of disputation," carried to a degree of
  acrimony and vehemence unsurpassed in lay controversies, seems to be
  found quite compatible with the "work and calling" of a remarkably large
  number of the clergy.</p>

  <p>Finally, it appears to me that nothing can be in worse taste than the
  assumption that a body of English gentlemen can, by any possibility,
  desire that immunity from criticism which the Duke of Argyll claims for
  them. Nothing would be more personally offensive to me than the
  supposition that I shirked criticism, just or unjust, of any lecture I
  ever gave. I should be utterly ashamed of myself if, when I stood up as
  an instructor of others, I had not taken every pains to assure myself of
  the truth of that which I was about to say; and I should feel myself
  bound to be even more careful with a popular assembly, who would take me
  more or less on trust, than with an audience of competent and critical
  experts.</p>

  <p>I decline to assume that the standard of morality, <!-- Page 268
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page268"></a>{268}</span>in these
  matters, is lower among the clergy than it is among scientific men. I
  refuse to think that the priest who stands up before a congregation, as
  the minister and interpreter of the Divinity, is less careful in his
  utterances, less ready to meet adverse comment, than the layman who comes
  before his audience, as the minister and interpreter of nature. Yet what
  should we think of the man of science who, when his ignorance or his
  carelessness was exposed, whined about the want of delicacy of his
  critics, or pleaded his "work and calling" as a reason for being let
  alone?</p>

  <p>No man, nor any body of men, is good enough, or wise enough, to
  dispense with the tonic of criticism. Nothing has done more harm to the
  clergy than the practice, too common among laymen, of regarding them,
  when in the pulpit, as a sort of chartered libertines, whose divagations
  are not to be taken seriously. And I am well assured that the
  distinguished divine, to whom the sermon is attributed, is the last
  person who would desire to avail himself of the dishonouring protection
  which has been superfluously thrown over him.</p>

  <p>So much for the lecture on propriety. But the Duke of Argyll, to whom
  the hortatory style seems to come naturally, does me the honour to make
  my sayings the subjects of a series of other admonitions, some on
  philosophical, some on geological, some on biological topics. I can but
  rejoice that the Duke's authority in these matters is not always employed
  to show that I am ignorant of them; on the contrary, I meet with an
  amount of agreement, even of <!-- Page 269 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page269"></a>{269}</span>approbation, for which I proffer such
  gratitude as may be due, even if that gratitude is sometimes almost
  overshadowed by surprise.</p>

  <p>I am unfeignedly astonished to find that the Duke of Argyll, who
  professes to intervene on behalf of the preacher, does really, like
  another Balaam, bless me altogether in respect of the main issue.</p>

  <p>I denied the justice of the preacher's ascription to men of science of
  the doctrine that miracles are incredible, because they are violations of
  natural law; and the Duke of Argyll says that he believes my "denial to
  be well founded. The preacher was answering an objection which has now
  been generally abandoned." Either the preacher knew this or he did not
  know it. It seems to me, as a mere lay teacher, to be a pity that the
  "great dome of St. Paul's" should have been made to "echo" (if so be that
  such stentorian effects were really produced) a statement which,
  admitting the first alternative, was unfair, and, admitting the second,
  was ignorant.<a name="NtA69" href="#Nt69"><sup>[69]</sup></a></p>

<p><!-- Page 270 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page270"></a>{270}</span></p>

  <p>Having thus sacrificed one half of the preacher's arguments, the Duke
  of Argyll proceeds to make equally short work with the other half. It
  appears that he fully accepts my position that the occurrence of those
  events, which the preacher speaks of as catastrophes, is no evidence of
  disorder, inasmuch as such catastrophes may be necessary occasional
  consequences of uniform changes. Whence I conclude, his Grace agrees with
  me, that the talk about royal laws "wrecking" ordinary laws may be
  eloquent metaphor, but is also nonsense.</p>

  <p>And now comes a further surprise. After having given these superfluous
  stabs to the slain body of the preacher's argument, my good ally remarks,
  with magnificent calmness: "So far, then, the preacher and the professor
  are at one." "Let them smoke the calumet." By all means: smoke would be
  the most appropriate symbol of this wonderful attempt to cover a retreat.
  After all, the Duke has come to bury the preacher, not to praise him;
  only he makes the funeral obsequies look as much like a triumphal
  procession as possible.</p>

  <p>So far as the questions between the preacher and myself are concerned,
  then, I may feel happy. The authority of the Duke of Argyll is ranged on
  my side. But the Duke has raised a number of other questions, with
  respect to which I fear I shall have to dispense with his
  support&mdash;nay, even be compelled to differ from him as much, or more,
  than I have done about his Grace's new rendering of the "benefit of
  clergy." <!-- Page 271 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page271"></a>{271}</span></p>

  <p>In discussing catastrophes, the Duke indulges in statements, partly
  scientific, partly anecdotic, which appear to me to be somewhat
  misleading. We are told, to begin with, that Sir Charles Lyell's doctrine
  respecting the proper mode of interpreting the facts of geology (which is
  commonly called uniformitarianism) "does not hold its head quite so high
  as it once did." That is great news indeed. But is it true? All I can say
  is that I am aware of nothing that has happened of late that can in any
  way justify it; and my opinion is, that the body of Lyell's doctrine, as
  laid down in that great work, <i>The Principles of Geology</i>, whatever
  may have happened to its head, is a chief and permanent constituent of
  the foundations of geological science.</p>

  <p>But this question cannot be advantageously discussed, unless we take
  some pains to discriminate between the essential part of the
  uniformitarian doctrine and its accessories; and it does not appear that
  the Duke of Argyll has carried his studies of geological philosophy so
  far as this point. For he defines uniformitarianism to be the assumption
  of the "extreme slowness and perfect continuity of all geological
  changes."</p>

  <p>What "perfect continuity" may mean in this definition, I am by no
  means sure; but I can only imagine that it signifies the absence of any
  break in the course of natural order during the millions of years, the
  lapse of which is recorded by geological phenomena.</p>

  <p>Is the Duke of Argyll prepared to say that any <!-- Page 272 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page272"></a>{272}</span>geologist of authority,
  at the present day, believes that there is the slightest evidence of the
  occurrence of supernatural intervention, during the long ages of which
  the monuments are preserved to us in the crust of the earth? And if he is
  not, in what sense has this part of the uniformitarian doctrine, as he
  defines it, lowered its pretensions to represent scientific truth?</p>

  <p>As to the "extreme slowness of all geological changes," it is simply a
  popular error to regard that as, in any wise, a fundamental and necessary
  dogma of uniformitarianism. It is extremely astonishing to me that any
  one who has carefully studied Lyell's great work can have so completely
  failed to appreciate its purport, which yet is "writ large" on the very
  title-page: "<i>The Principles of Geology, being an attempt to explain
  the former changes of the earth's surface by reference to causes now in
  operation</i>." The essence of Lyell's doctrine is here written so that
  those who run may read; and it has nothing to do with the quickness or
  slowness of the past changes of the earth's surface; except in so far as
  existing analogous changes may go on slowly, and therefore create a
  presumption in favour of the slowness of past changes.</p>

  <p>With that epigrammatic force which characterises his style, Buffon
  wrote, nearly a hundred and fifty years ago, in his famous <i>Théorie de
  la Terre</i>: "Pour juger de ce qui est arrivé, et même de ce qui
  arrivera, nous n'avons qu'à examiner ce qui arrive." The key of the past,
  as of the future, is to be sought in the present, and only when known
  causes of change have <!-- Page 273 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page273"></a>{273}</span>been shown to be insufficient have we any
  right to have recourse to unknown causes. Geology is as much a historical
  science as archæology; and I apprehend that all sound historical
  investigation rests upon this axiom. It underlay all Hutton's work and
  animated Lyell and Scrope in their successful efforts to revolutionise
  the geology of half a century ago.</p>

  <p>There is no antagonism whatever, and there never was, between the
  belief in the views which had their chief and unwearied advocate in Lyell
  and the belief in the occurrence of catastrophes. The first edition of
  Lyell's <i>Principles</i>, published in 1830, lies before me; and a large
  part of the first volume is occupied by an account of volcanic, seismic,
  and diluvial catastrophes which have occurred within the historical
  period. Moreover, the author, over and over again, expressly draws the
  attention of his readers to the consistency of catastrophes with his
  doctrine.</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>Notwithstanding, therefore, that we have not witnessed within the last
  three thousand years the devastation by deluge of a large continent, yet,
  as we may predict the future occurrence of such catastrophes, we are
  authorised to regard them as part of the present order of nature, and
  they may be introduced into geological speculations respecting the past,
  provided that we do not imagine them to have been more frequent or
  general than we expect them to be in time to come (vol. i. p. 89).</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>Again:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>If we regard each of the causes separately, which we know to be at
  present the most instrumental in remodelling the state of the surface, we
  shall find that we must expect each to be in action for thousands of
  years, without producing any extensive <!-- Page 274 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page274"></a>{274}</span>alterations in the
  habitable surface, and then to give rise, during a very brief period, to
  important revolutions (vol. ii. p. 161).<a name="NtA70"
  href="#Nt70"><sup>[70]</sup></a></p>

</blockquote>

  <p>Lyell quarrelled with the catastrophists then, by no means because
  they assumed that catastrophes occur and have occurred, but because they
  had got into the habit of calling on their god Catastrophe to help them,
  when they ought to have been putting their shoulders to the wheel of
  observation of the present course of nature, in order to help themselves
  out of their difficulties. And geological science has become what it is,
  chiefly because geologists have gradually accepted Lyell's doctrine and
  followed his precepts.</p>

  <p>So far as I know anything about the matter, there is nothing that can
  be called proof, that the causes of geological phenomena operated more
  intensely or more rapidly, at any time between the older tertiary and the
  oldest palæozoic epochs than they have done between the older tertiary
  epoch and the present day. And if that is so, uniformitarianism, even as
  limited by Lyell,<a name="NtA71" href="#Nt71"><sup>[71]</sup></a> has no
  call to lower its crest. But if the facts were otherwise, the position
  Lyell took up remains <!-- Page 275 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page275"></a>{275}</span>impregnable. He did not say that the
  geological operations of nature were never more rapid, or more vast, than
  they are now; what he did maintain is the very different proposition that
  there is no good evidence of anything of the kind. And that proposition
  has not yet been shown to be incorrect.</p>

  <p>I owe more than I can tell to the careful study of the <i>Principles
  of Geology</i> in my young days; and, long before the year 1856, my mind
  was familiar with the truth that "the doctrine of uniformity is not
  incompatible with great and sudden changes," which, as I have shown, is
  taught <i>totidem verbis</i> in that work. Even had it been possible for
  me to shut my eyes to the sense of what I had read in the
  <i>Principles</i>, Whewell's <i>Philosophy of the Inductive Sciences</i>,
  published in 1840, a work with which I was also tolerably familiar, must
  have opened them. For the always acute, if not always profound, author,
  in arguing against Lyell's uniformitarianism, expressly points out that
  it does not in any way contravene the occurrence of catastrophes.</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>With regard to such occurrences [earthquakes, deluges, etc.], terrible
  as they appear at the time, they may not much affect the <!-- Page 276

  of change: there may be a <i>cycle</i>, though an irregular one, of rapid

  ventured to point out, in the presence and in the hearing of that most
  distinguished man [Sir C. Lyell] that the doctrine of uniformity was not
  incompatible with great and sudden changes, since cycles of these and
  other cycles of comparative rest might well be constituent parts of that
  uniformity which he asserted. Lyell did not object to this extended
  interpretation of his own doctrine, and indeed expressed to me his entire
  concurrence.</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>I should think he did; for, as I have shown, there was nothing in it
  that Lyell himself had not said, six-and-twenty years before, and
  enforced, three years before; and it is almost verbally identical with
  the view of uniformitarianism taken by Whewell, sixteen years before, in
  a work with which, one would think, that any one who undertakes to
  discuss the philosophy of science should be familiar.</p>

  <p>Thirty years have elapsed since the beginner of 1856 persuaded himself
  that he enlightened the foremost geologist of his time, and one of the
  most acute and far-seeing men of science of any time, as to the scope of
  the doctrines which the veteran philosopher <!-- Page 277 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page277"></a>{277}</span>had grown gray in
  promulgating; and the Duke of Argyll's acquaintance with the literature
  of geology has not, even now, become sufficiently profound to dissipate
  that pleasant delusion.</p>

  <p>If the Duke of Argyll's guidance in that branch of physical science,
  with which alone he has given evidence of any practical acquaintance, is
  thus unsafe, I may breathe more freely in setting my opinion against the
  authoritative deliverances of his Grace about matters which lie outside
  the province of geology.</p>

  <p>And here the Duke's paper offers me such a wealth of opportunities
  that choice becomes embarrassing. I must bear in mind the good old adage,
  "Non multa sed multum." Tempting as it would be to follow the Duke
  through his labyrinthine misunderstandings of the ordinary terminology of
  philosophy, and to comment on the curious unintelligibility which hangs
  about his frequent outpourings of fervid language, limits of space oblige
  me to restrict myself to those points, the discussion of which may help
  to enlighten the public in respect of matters of more importance than the
  competence of my Mentor for the task which he has undertaken.</p>

  <p>I am not sure when the employment of the word Law, in the sense in
  which we speak of laws of nature, commenced, but examples of it may be
  found in the works of Bacon, Descartes, and Spinoza. Bacon employs "Law"
  as the equivalent of "Form," and I am inclined to think that he may be
  responsible for a good deal of the confusion that has subsequently <!--
  Page 278 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page278"></a>{278}</span>arisen; but I am not aware that the term
  is used by other authorities, in the seventeenth and eighteenth
  centuries, in any other sense than that of "rule" or "definite order" of
  the coexistence of things or succession of events in nature. Descartes
  speaks of "règles, que je nomme les lois de la nature." Leibnitz says
  "loi ou règle générale," as if he considered the terms
  interchangeable.</p>

  <p>The Duke of Argyll, however, affirms that the "law of gravitation" as
  put forth by Newton was something more than the statement of an observed
  order. He admits that Kepler's three laws "were an observed order of
  facts and nothing more." As to the law of gravitation, "it contains an
  element which Kepler's laws did not contain, even an element of
  causation, the recognition of which belongs to a higher category of
  intellectual conceptions than that which is concerned in the mere
  observation and record of separate and apparently unconnected facts."
  There is hardly a line in these paragraphs which appears to me to be
  indisputable. But, to confine myself to the matter in hand, I cannot
  conceive that any one who had taken ordinary pains to acquaint himself
  with the real nature of either Kepler's or Newton's work could have
  written them. That the labours of Kepler, of all men in the world, should
  be called "mere observation and record," is truly wonderful. And any one
  who will look into the <i>Principia</i>, or the <i>Optics</i>, or the
  <i>Letters to Bentley</i>, will see, even if he has no more special
  knowledge of the topics discussed than I have, that Newton over and over
  again insisted that he had <!-- Page 279 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page279"></a>{279}</span>nothing to do with gravitation as a
  physical cause, and that when he used the terms attraction, force, and
  the like, he employed them, as he says, "<i>mathematicè</i>" and not
  "<i>physicè</i>".</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>How these attractions [of gravity, magnetism, and electricity] may be
  performed, I do not here consider. What I call attraction may be
  performed by impulse or by some other means unknown to me. I use that
  word here to signify only in a general way any force by which bodies tend
  towards one another, whatever be the cause.<a name="NtA74"
  href="#Nt74"><sup>[74]</sup></a></p>

</blockquote>

  <p>According to my reading of the best authorities upon the history of
  science, Newton discovered neither gravitation, nor the law of
  gravitation; nor did he pretend to offer more than a conjecture as to the
  causation of gravitation. Moreover, his assertion that the notion of a
  body acting where it is not, is one that no competent thinker could
  entertain, is antagonistic to the whole current conception of attractive
  and repulsive forces, and therefore of "the attractive force of
  gravitation." What, then, was that labour of unsurpassed magnitude and
  excellence and immortal influence which Newton did perform? In the first
  place, Newton defined the laws, rules, or observed order of the phenomena
  of motion, which come under our daily observation, with greater precision
  than had been before attained; and, by following out with marvellous
  power and subtlety the mathematical consequences of these rules, he
  almost created the modern science of pure mechanics. In the second place,
  applying exactly the same method <!-- Page 280 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page280"></a>{280}</span>to the explication of
  the facts of astronomy as that which was applied a century and a half
  later to the facts of geology by Lyell, he set himself to solve the
  following problem. Assuming that all bodies, free to move, tend to
  approach one another as the earth and the bodies on it do; assuming that
  the strength of that tendency is directly as the mass and inversely as
  the squares of the distances; assuming that the laws of motion,
  determined for terrestrial bodies, hold good throughout the universe;
  assuming that the planets and their satellites were created and placed at
  their observed mean distances, and that each received a certain impulse
  from the Creator; will the form of the orbits, the varying rates of
  motion of the planets, and the ratio between those rates and their
  distances from the sun which must follow by mathematical reasoning from
  these premisses, agree with the order of facts determined by Kepler and
  others, or not?</p>

  <p>Newton, employing mathematical methods which are the admiration of
  adepts, but which no one but himself appears to have been able to use
  with ease, not only answered this question in the affirmative, but stayed
  not his constructive genius before it had founded modern physical
  astronomy.</p>

  <p>The historians of mechanical and of astronomical science appear to be
  agreed that he was the first person who clearly and distinctly put forth
  the hypothesis that the phenomena comprehended under the general name of
  "gravity" follow the same order throughout the universe, and that all
  material bodies exhibit these phenomena; so that, in this sense, the <!--
  Page 281 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page281"></a>{281}</span>idea
  of universal gravitation may, doubtless, be properly ascribed to him.</p>

  <p>Newton proved that the laws of Kepler were particular consequences of
  the laws of motion and the law of gravitation&mdash;in other words, the
  reason of the first lay in the two latter. But to talk of the law of
  gravitation alone as the reason of Kepler's laws, and still more as
  standing in any causal relation to Kepler's laws, is simply a misuse of
  language. It would really be interesting if the Duke of Argyll would
  explain how he proposes to set about showing that the elliptical form of
  the orbits of the planets, the constant area described by the radius
  vector, and the proportionality of the squares of the periodic times to
  the cubes of the distances from the sun, are either caused by the "force
  of gravitation" or deducible from the "law of gravitation." I conceive
  that it would be about as apposite to say that the various compounds of
  nitrogen with oxygen are caused by chemical attraction and deducible from
  the atomic theory.</p>

  <p>&nbsp;</p>

  <p>Newton assuredly lent no shadow of support to the modern
  pseudo-scientific philosophy which confounds laws with causes. I have not
  taken the trouble to trace out this commonest of fallacies to its first
  beginning; but I was familiar with it in full bloom, more than thirty
  years ago, in a work which had a great vogue in its day&mdash;the
  <i>Vestiges of the Natural History of Creation</i>&mdash;of which the
  first edition was published in 1844.</p>

  <p>It is full of apt and forcible illustrations of <!-- Page 282 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page282"></a>{282}</span>pseudoscientific
  realism. Consider, for example, this gem serene. When a boy who has
  climbed a tree loses his hold of the branch, "the law of gravitation
  unrelentingly pulls him to the ground, and then he is hurt," whereby the
  Almighty is quite relieved from any responsibility for the accident. Here
  is the "law of gravitation" acting as a cause in a way quite in
  accordance with the Duke of Argyll's conception of it. In fact, in the
  mind of the author of the <i>Vestiges</i>, "laws" are existences
  intermediate between the Creator and his works, like the "ideas" of the
  Platonisers or the Logos of the Alexandrians.<a name="NtA75"
  href="#Nt75"><sup>[75]</sup></a> I may cite a passage which is quite in
  the vein of Philo:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>We have seen powerful evidences that the construction of this globe
  and its associates; and, inferentially, that of all the other globes in
  space, was the result, not of any immediate or personal exertion on the
  part of the Deity, but of natural laws which are the expression of his
  will. What is to hinder our supposing that the organic creation is also a
  result of natural laws which are in like manner an expression of his
  will? (p. 154, 1st edition).</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>And creation "operating by law" is constantly cited as relieving the
  Creator from trouble about insignificant details.</p>

  <p>I am perplexed to picture to myself the state of mind which accepts
  these verbal juggleries. It is intelligible that the Creator should
  operate according to such rules as he might think fit to lay down for
  himself (and therefore according to law); but that would leave the
  operation of his will just as much a direct personal act as it would be
  under any other <!-- Page 283 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page283"></a>{283}</span>circumstances. I can also understand that
  (as in Leibnitz's caricature of Newton's views) the Creator might have
  made the cosmical machine, and, after setting it going, have left it to
  itself till it needed repair. But then, by the supposition, his personal
  responsibility would have been involved in all that it did, just as much
  as a dynamiter is responsible for what happens when he has set his
  machine going and left it to explode.</p>

  <p>The only hypothesis which gives a sort of mad consistency to the
  Vestigiarian's views is the supposition that laws are a kind of angels or
  demiurgoi, who, being supplied with the Great Architect's plan, were
  permitted to settle the details among themselves. Accepting this
  doctrine, the conception of royal laws and plebeian laws, and of those
  more than Homeric contests in which the big laws "wreck" the little ones,
  becomes quite intelligible. And, in fact, the honour of the paternity of
  those remarkable ideas which come into full flower in the preacher's
  discourse, must, so far as my imperfect knowledge goes, be attributed to
  the author of the <i>Vestiges</i>.</p>

  <p>But the author of the <i>Vestiges</i> is not the only writer who is
  responsible for the current pseudo-scientific mystifications which hang
  about the term "law." When I wrote my paper about "Scientific and
  Pseudo-Scientific Realism," I had not read a work by the Duke of Argyll,
  <i>The Reign of Law</i>, which, I believe, has enjoyed, possibly still
  enjoys, a widespread popularity. But the vivacity of the Duke's attack
  led me to think it possible that criticisms directed elsewhere might have
  come home to <!-- Page 284 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page284"></a>{284}</span>him. And, in fact, I find that the second
  chapter of the work in question, which is entitled "Law; its
  definitions," is, from my point of view, a sort of "summa" of
  pseudo-scientific philosophy. It will be worth while to examine it in
  some detail.</p>

  <p>In the first place, it is to be noted that the author of the <i>Reign
  of Law</i> admits that "law," in many cases, means nothing more than the
  statement of the order in which facts occur, or, as he says, "an observed
  order of facts" (p. 66). But his appreciation of the value of accuracy of
  expression does not hinder him from adding, almost in the same breath,
  "In this sense the laws of nature are simply those facts of nature which
  recur according to rule" (p. 66). Thus "laws," which were rightly said to
  be the statement of an order of facts in one paragraph, are declared to
  be the facts themselves in the next.</p>

  <p>We are next told that, though it may be customary and permissible to
  use "law" in the sense of a statement of the order of facts, this is a
  low use of the word; and indeed, two pages farther on, the writer, flatly
  contradicting himself, altogether denies its admissibility.</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>An observed order of facts, to be entitled to the rank of a law, must
  be an order so constant and uniform as to indicate necessity, and
  necessity can only arise out of the action of some compelling force (p.
  68).</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>This is undoubtedly one of the most singular propositions that I have
  ever met with in a professedly scientific work, and its rarity is
  embellished by another direct self-contradiction which it implies. For
  <!-- Page 285 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page285"></a>{285}</span>on the preceding page (67), when the Duke
  of Argyll is speaking of the laws of Kepler, which he admits to be laws,
  and which are types of that which men of science understand by "laws," he
  says that they are "simply and purely an order of facts." Moreover, he
  adds: "A very large proportion of the laws of every science are laws of
  this kind and in this sense."</p>

  <p>If, according to the Duke of Argyll's admission, law is understood, in
  this sense, thus widely and constantly by scientific authorities, where
  is the justification for his unqualified assertion that such statements
  of the observed order of facts are not "entitled to the rank" of
  laws?</p>

  <p>But let us examine the consequences of the really interesting
  proposition I have just quoted. I presume that it is a law of nature that
  "a straight line is the shortest distance between two points." This law
  affirms the constant association of a certain fact of form with a certain
  fact of dimension. Whether the notion of necessity which attaches to it
  has an <i>à priori</i> or an <i>à posteriori</i> origin is a question not
  relevant to the present discussion. But I would beg to be informed, if it
  is necessary, where is the "compelling force" out of which the necessity
  arises; and further, if it is not necessary, whether it loses the
  character of a law of nature?</p>

  <p>I take it to be a law of nature, based on unexceptionable evidence,
  that the mass of matter remains unchanged, whatever chemical or other
  modifications it may undergo. This law is one of the foundations of
  chemistry. But it is by no means necessary. It <!-- Page 286 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page286"></a>{286}</span>is quite possible to
  imagine that the mass of matter should vary according to circumstances,
  as we know its weight does. Moreover, the determination of the "force"
  which makes mass constant (if there is any intelligibility in that form
  of words) would not, so far as I can see, confer any more validity on the
  law than it has now.</p>

  <p>There is a law of nature, so well vouched by experience, that all
  mankind, from pure logicians in search of examples to parish sextons in
  search of fees, confide in it. This is the law that "all men are mortal."
  It is simply a statement of the observed order of facts that all men
  sooner or later die. I am not acquainted with any law of nature which is
  more "constant and uniform" than this. But will any one tell me that
  death is "necessary"? Certainly there is no <i>à priori</i> necessity in
  the case, for various men have been imagined to be immortal. And I should
  be glad to be informed of any "necessity" that can be deduced from
  biological considerations. It is quite conceivable, as has recently been
  pointed out, that some of the lowest forms of life may be immortal, after
  a fashion. However this may be, I would further ask, supposing "all men
  are mortal" to be a real law of nature, where and what is that to which,
  with any propriety, the title of "compelling force" of the law can be
  given?</p>

  <p>On page 69, the Duke of Argyll asserts that the law of gravitation "is
  a law in the sense, not merely of a rule, but of a cause." But this
  revival of the teaching of the <i>Vestiges</i> has already been examined
  <!-- Page 287 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page287"></a>{287}</span>and disposed of; and when the Duke of
  Argyll states that the "observed order" which Kepler had discovered was
  simply a necessary consequence of the force of "gravitation," I need not
  recapitulate the evidence which proves such a statement to be wholly
  fallacious. But it may be useful to say, once more, that, at this present
  moment, nobody knows anything about the existence of a "force" of
  gravitation apart from the fact; that Newton declared the ordinary notion
  of such force to be inconceivable; that various attempts have been made
  to account for the order of facts we call gravitation, without recourse
  to the notion of attractive force; that, if such a force exists, it is
  utterly incompetent to account for Kepler's laws, without taking into the
  reckoning a great number of other considerations; and, finally, that all
  we know about the "force" of gravitation, or any other so-called "force,"
  is that it is a name for the hypothetical cause of an observed order of
  facts.</p>

  <p>Thus, when the Duke of Argyll says: "Force, ascertained according to
  some measure of its operation&mdash;this is indeed one of the
  definitions, but only one, of a scientific law" (p. 71), I reply that it
  is a definition which must be repudiated by every one who possesses an
  adequate acquaintance with either the facts, or the philosophy, of
  science and relegated to the limbo of pseudo-scientific fallacies. If the
  human mind had never entertained this notion of "force," nay, if it
  substituted bare invariable succession for the ordinary notion of
  causation, the idea of law, as the expression of a constantly-observed
  order, which <!-- Page 288 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page288"></a>{288}</span>generates a corresponding intensity of
  expectation in our minds, would have exactly the same value, and play its
  part in real science, exactly as it does now.</p>

  <p>It is needless to extend further the present excursus on the origin
  and history of modern pseudo-science. Under such high patronage as it has
  enjoyed, it has grown and flourished until, nowadays, it is becoming
  somewhat rampant. It has its weekly "Ephemerides," in which every new
  pseudo-scientific mare's-nest is hailed and belauded with the unconscious
  unfairness of ignorance; and an army of "reconcilers," enlisted in its
  service, whose business seems to be to mix the black of dogma and the
  white of science into the neutral tint of what they call liberal
  theology.</p>

  <p>I remember that, not long after the publication of the
  <i>Vestiges</i>, a shrewd and sarcastic countryman of the author defined
  it as "cauld kail made het again." A cynic might find amusement in the
  reflection that, at the present time, the principles and the methods of
  the much-vilified Vestigiarian are being "made het again"; and are not
  only "echoed by the dome of St. Paul's," but thundered from the castle of
  Inveraray. But my turn of mind is not cynical, and I can but regret the
  waste of time and energy bestowed on the endeavour to deal with the most
  difficult problems of science, by those who have neither undergone the
  discipline, nor possess the information, which are indispensable to the
  successful issue of such an enterprise.</p>

  <p>I have already had occasion to remark that the <!-- Page 289 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page289"></a>{289}</span>Duke of Argyll's views
  of the conduct of controversy are different from mine; and this
  much-to-be-lamented discrepancy becomes yet more accentuated when the
  Duke reaches biological topics. Anything that was good enough for Sir
  Charles Lyell, in his department of study, is certainly good enough for
  me in mine; and I by no means demur to being pedagogically instructed
  about a variety of matters with which it has been the business of my life
  to try to acquaint myself. But the Duke of Argyll is not content with
  favouring me with his opinions about my own business; he also answers for
  mine; and, at that point, really the worm must turn. I am told that "no
  one knows better than Professor Huxley" a variety of things which I
  really do not know; and I am said to be a disciple of that "Positive
  Philosophy" which I have, over and over again, publicly repudiated in
  language which is certainly not lacking in intelligibility, whatever may
  be its other defects.</p>

  <p>I am told that I have been amusing myself with a "metaphysical
  exercitation or logomachy" (may I remark incidentally that these are not
  quite convertible terms?), when, to the best of my belief, I have been
  trying to expose a process of mystification, based upon the use of
  scientific language by writers who exhibit no sign of scientific
  training, of accurate scientific knowledge, or of clear ideas respecting
  the philosophy of science, which is doing very serious harm to the
  public. Naturally enough, they take the lion's skin of scientific
  phraseology for evidence that the voice which issues from beneath it is
  the voice of <!-- Page 290 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page290"></a>{290}</span>science, and I desire to relieve them from
  the consequences of their error.</p>

  <p>The Duke of Argyll asks, apparently with sorrow that it should be his
  duty to subject me to reproof&mdash;</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>What shall we say of a philosophy which confounds the organic with the
  inorganic, and, refusing to take note of a difference so profound,
  assumes to explain under one common abstraction, the movements due to
  gravitation and the movements due to the mind of man?</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>To which I may fitly reply by another question: What shall we say to a
  controversialist who attributes to the subject of his attack opinions
  which are notoriously not his; and expresses himself in such a manner
  that it is obvious he is unacquainted with even the rudiments of that
  knowledge which is necessary to the discussion into which he has
  rushed?</p>

  <p>What line of my writing can the Duke of Argyll produce which confounds
  the organic with the inorganic?</p>

  <p>As to the latter half of the paragraph, I have to confess a doubt
  whether it has any definite meaning. But I imagine that the Duke is
  alluding to my assertion that the law of gravitation is nowise
  "suspended" or "defied" when a man lifts his arm; but that, under such
  circumstances, part of the store of energy in the universe operates on
  the arm at a mechanical advantage as against the operation of another
  part. I was simple enough to think that no one who had as much knowledge
  of physiology as is to be found in an elementary primer, or who had ever
  heard of the greatest physical generalisation of modern <!-- Page 291
  --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page291"></a>{291}</span>times&mdash;the doctrine of the
  conservation of energy&mdash;would dream of doubting my statement; and I
  was further simple enough to think that no one who lacked these
  qualifications would feel tempted to charge me with error. It appears
  that my simplicity is greater than my powers of imagination.</p>

  <p>The Duke of Argyll may not be aware of the fact, but it is
  nevertheless true, that when a man's arm is raised, in sequence to that
  state of consciousness we call a volition, the volition is not the
  immediate cause of the elevation of the arm. On the contrary, that
  operation is effected by a certain change of form, technically known as
  "contraction," in sundry masses of flesh, technically known as muscles,
  which are fixed to the bones of the shoulder in such a manner that, if
  these muscles contract, they must raise the arm. Now each of these
  muscles is a machine comparable, in a certain sense, to one of the
  donkey-engines of a steamship, but more complete, inasmuch as the source
  of its ability to change its form, or contract, lies within itself. Every
  time that, by contracting, the muscle does work, such as that involved in
  raising the arm, more or less of the material which it contains is used
  up, just as more or less of the fuel of a steam-engine is used up, when
  it does work. And I do not think there is a doubt in the mind of any
  competent physicist or physiologist that the work done in lifting the
  weight of the arm is the mechanical equivalent of a certain proportion of
  the energy set free by the molecular changes which take place in the
  muscle. It is further a tolerably <!-- Page 292 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page292"></a>{292}</span>well-based belief that
  this, and all other forms of energy, are mutually convertible; and,
  therefore, that they all come under that general law or statement of the
  order of facts, called the conservation of energy. And, as that certainly
  is an abstraction, so the view which the Duke of Argyll thinks so
  extremely absurd is really one of the commonplaces of physiology. But
  this Review is hardly an appropriate place for giving instruction in the
  elements of that science, and I content myself with recommending the Duke
  of Argyll to devote some study to Book II. chap. v. section 4 of my
  friend Dr. Foster's excellent textbook of Physiology (1st edition, 1877,
  p. 321), which begins thus:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>Broadly speaking, the animal body is a machine for converting
  potential into actual energy. The potential energy is supplied by the
  food; this the metabolism of the body converts into the actual energy of
  heat and mechanical labour.</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>There is no more difficult problem in the world than that of the
  relation of the state of consciousness, termed volition, to the
  mechanical work which frequently follows upon it. But no one can even
  comprehend the nature of the problem, who has not carefully studied the
  long series of modes of motion which, without a break, connect the energy
  which does that work with the general store of energy. The ultimate form
  of the problem is this: Have we any reason to believe that a feeling, or
  state of consciousness, is capable of directly affecting the motion of
  even the smallest conceivable molecule of matter? Is such a thing even
  conceivable? If we answer these <!-- Page 293 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page293"></a>{293}</span>questions in the negative, it follows that
  volition may be a sign, but cannot be a cause, of bodily motion. If we
  answer them in the affirmative, then states of consciousness become
  undistinguishable from material things; for it is the essential nature of
  matter to be the vehicle or substratum of mechanical energy.</p>

  <p>There is nothing new in all this. I have merely put into modern
  language the issue raised by Descartes more than two centuries ago. The
  philosophies of the Occasionalists, of Spinoza, of Malebranche, of modern
  idealism and modern materialism, have all grown out of the controversies
  which Cartesianism evoked. Of all this the pseudo-science of the present
  time appears to be unconscious; otherwise it would hardly content itself
  with "making het again" the pseudo-science of the past.</p>

  <p>In the course of these observations I have already had occasion to
  express my appreciation of the copious and perfervid eloquence which
  enriches the Duke of Argyll's pages. I am almost ashamed that a
  constitutional insensibility to the Sirenian charms of rhetoric has
  permitted me, in wandering through these flowery meads, to be attracted,
  almost exclusively, to the bare places of fallacy and the stony grounds
  of deficient information, which are disguised, though not concealed, by
  these floral decorations. But, in his concluding sentences, the Duke
  soars into a Tyrtæan strain which roused even my dull soul.</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>It was high time, indeed, that some revolt should be raised against

  it. The time is coming when that revolt will be carried further. Higher
  interpretations will be established. Unless I am much mistaken, they are
  already coming in sight (p. 339).</p>

  <p>I have been living very much out of the world for the last two or
  three years, and when I read this denunciatory outburst, as of one filled
  with the spirit of prophecy, I said to myself, "Mercy upon us, what has
  happened? Can it be that X. and Y. (it would be wrong to mention the
  names of the vigorous young friends which occurred to me) are playing
  Danton and Robespierre; and that a guillotine is erected in the courtyard
  of Burlington House for the benefit of all anti-Darwinian Fellows of the
  Royal Society? Where are the secret conspirators against this tyranny,
  whom I am supposed to favour, and yet not have the courage to join
  openly? And to think of my poor oppressed friend, Mr. Herbert Spencer,
  'compelled to speak with bated breath' (p. 338) certainly for the first
  time in my thirty-odd years' acquaintance with him!" My alarm and horror
  at the supposition that, while I had been fiddling (or at any rate
  physicking), my beloved Rome had been burning, in this fashion, may be
  imagined.</p>

  <p>I am sure the Duke of Argyll will be glad to hear that the anxiety he
  created was of extremely short duration. It is my privilege to have
  access to the best sources of information, and nobody in the scientific
  world can tell me anything about either the "Reign of <!-- Page 295
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page295"></a>{295}</span>Terror" or
  "the Revolt." In fact, the scientific world laughs most indecorously at
  the notion of the existence of either; and some are so lost to the sense
  of the scientific dignity, that they descend to the use of transatlantic
  slang, and call it a "bogus scare." As to my friend Mr. Herbert Spencer,
  I have every reason to know that, in the <i>Factors of Organic
  Evolution</i>, he has said exactly what was in his mind, without any
  particular deference to the opinions of the person whom he is pleased to
  regard as his most dangerous critic and Devil's Advocate-General, and
  still less of any one else.</p>

  <p>I do not know whether the Duke of Argyll pictures himself as the
  Tallien of this imaginary revolt against a no less imaginary Reign of
  Terror. But if so, I most respectfully but firmly decline to join his
  forces. It is only a few weeks since I happened to read over again the
  first article which I ever wrote (now twenty-seven years ago) on the
  <i>Origin of Species</i>, and I found nothing that I wished to modify in
  the opinions that are there expressed, though the subsequent vast
  accumulation of evidence in favour of Mr. Darwin's views would give me
  much to add. As is the case with all new doctrines, so with that of
  Evolution, the enthusiasm of advocates has sometimes tended to degenerate
  into fanaticism; and mere speculation has, at times, threatened to shoot
  beyond its legitimate bounds. I have occasionally thought it wise to warn
  the more adventurous spirits among us against these dangers, in
  sufficiently plain language; and I have sometimes jestingly said that I
  expected, <!-- Page 296 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page296"></a>{296}</span>if I lived long enough, to be looked on as
  a reactionary by some of my more ardent friends. But nothing short of
  midsummer madness can account for the fiction that I am waiting till it
  is safe to join openly a revolt, hatched by some person or persons
  unknown, against an intellectual movement with which I am in the most
  entire and hearty sympathy. It is a great many years since, at the outset
  of my career, I had to think seriously what life had to offer that was
  worth having. I came to the conclusion that the chief good, for me, was
  freedom to learn, think, and say what I pleased, when I pleased. I have
  acted on that conviction, and have availed myself of the "rara temporum
  felicitas ubi sentire quæ velis, et quæ sentias dicere licet," which is
  now enjoyable, to the best of my ability; and though strongly, and
  perhaps wisely, warned that I should probably come to grief, I am
  entirely satisfied with the results of the line of action I have
  adopted.</p>

  <p>My career is at an end. I have</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>Warmed both hands before the fire of life;</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>and nothing is left me, before I depart, but to help, or at any rate
  to abstain from hindering, the younger generation of men of science in
  doing better service to the cause we have at heart than I have been able
  to render.</p>

  <p>And yet, forsooth, I am supposed to be waiting for the signal of
  "revolt," which some fiery spirits among these young men are to raise
  before I dare express my real opinions concerning questions about which
  we <!-- Page 297 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page297"></a>{297}</span>older men had to fight, in the teeth of
  fierce public opposition and obloquy&mdash;of something which might
  almost justify even the grandiloquent epithet of a Reign of
  Terror&mdash;before our excellent successors had left school.</p>

  <p>It would appear that the spirit of pseudo-science has impregnated even
  the imagination of the Duke of Argyll. The scientific imagination always
  restrains itself within the limits of probability.</p>

<h3>VIII</h3>

<h3>AN EPISCOPAL TRILOGY</h3>

  <p>If there is any truth in the old adage that a burnt child dreads the
  fire, I ought to be very loath to touch a sermon, while the memory of
  what befell me on a recent occasion, possibly not yet forgotten by the
  readers of this Review, is uneffaced. But I suppose that even the
  distinguished censor of that unheard-of audacity to which not even the
  newspaper report of a sermon is sacred, can hardly regard a man of
  science as either indelicate or presumptuous, if he ventures to offer
  some comments upon three discourses, specially addressed to the great
  assemblage of men of science which recently gathered at Manchester, by
  three bishops of the State Church. On my return to England not long ago,
  I found a pamphlet<a name="NtA76" href="#Nt76"><sup>[76]</sup></a>
  containing a version, which I presume to be authorised, of these sermons,
  among the huge mass of letters and papers which had accumulated during
  two months' absence; and I have read them not only <!-- Page 299 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page299"></a>{299}</span>with attentive
  interest, but with a feeling of satisfaction which is quite new to me as
  a result of hearing, or reading, sermons. These excellent discourses, in
  fact, appear to me to signalise a new departure in the course adopted by
  theology towards science, and to indicate the possibility of bringing
  about an honourable <i>modus vivendi</i> between the two. How far the
  three bishops speak as accredited representatives of the Church is a
  question to be considered by and by. Most assuredly, I am not authorised
  to represent any one but myself. But I suppose that there must be a good
  many people in the Church of the bishops' way of thinking; and I have
  reason to believe that, in the ranks of science, there are a good many
  persons who, more or less, share my views. And it is to these sensible
  people on both sides, as the bishops and I must needs think those who
  agree with us, that my present observations are addressed. They will
  probably be astonished to learn how insignificant, in principle, their
  differences are.</p>

  <p>It is impossible to read the discourses of the three prelates without
  being impressed by the knowledge which they display, and by the spirit of
  equity, I might say of generosity, towards science which pervades them.
  There is no trace of that tacit or open assumption that the rejection of
  theological dogmas, on scientific grounds, is due to moral perversity,
  which is the ordinary note of ecclesiastical homilies on this subject,
  and which makes them look so supremely silly to men whose lives have been
  spent in wrestling with these questions. There is no attempt to hide <!--
  Page 300 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page300"></a>{300}</span>away
  real stumbling-blocks under rhetorical stucco; no resort to the <i>tu
  quoque</i> device of setting scientific blunders against theological
  errors; no suggestion that an honest man may keep contradictory beliefs
  in separate pockets of his brain; no question that the method of
  scientific investigation is valid, whatever the results to which it may
  lead; and that the search after truth, and truth only, ennobles the
  searcher and leaves no doubt that his life, at any rate, is worth living.
  The Bishop of Carlisle declares himself pledged to the belief that "the
  advancement of science, the progress of human knowledge, is in itself a
  worthy aim of the greatest effort of the greatest minds."</p>

  <p>How often was it my fate, a quarter of a century ago, to see the whole
  artillery of the pulpit brought to bear upon the doctrine of evolution
  and its supporters! Any one unaccustomed to the amenities of
  ecclesiastical controversy would have thought we were too wicked to be
  permitted to live. But let us hear the Bishop of Bedford. After a
  perfectly frank statement of the doctrine of evolution and some of its
  obvious consequences, that learned prelate pleads, with all earnestness,
  against</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>a hasty denunciation of what <i>may</i> be proved to have at least
  some elements of truth in it, a contemptuous rejection of theories which
  we <i>may</i> some day learn to accept as freely and with as little sense
  of inconsistency with God's word as we now accept the theory of the
  earth's motion round the sun, or the long duration of the geological
  epochs (p. 28).</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>I do not see that the most convinced evolutionist could ask any one,
  whether cleric or layman, to say <!-- Page 301 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page301"></a>{301}</span>more than this; in
  fact, I do not think that any one has a right to say more, with respect
  to any question about which two opinions can be held, than that his mind
  is perfectly open to the force of evidence.</p>

  <p>There is another portion of the Bishop of Bedford's sermon which I
  think will be warmly appreciated by all honest and clear-headed men. He
  repudiates the views of those who say that theology and science</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>occupy wholly different spheres, and need in no way intermeddle with
  each other. They revolve, as it were, in different planes, and so never
  meet. Thus we may pursue scientific studies with the utmost freedom and,
  at the same time, may pay the most reverent regard to theology, having no
  fears of collision, because allowing no points of contact (p. 29).</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>Surely every unsophisticated mind will heartily concur with the
  Bishop's remark upon this convenient refuge for the descendants of Mr.
  Facing-both-ways. "I have never been able to understand this position,
  though I have often seen it assumed." Nor can any demurrer be sustained
  when the Bishop proceeds to point out that there are, and must be,
  various points of contact between theological and natural science, and
  therefore that it is foolish to ignore or deny the existence of as many
  dangers of collision.</p>

  <p>Finally, the Bishop of Manchester freely admits the force of the
  objections which have been raised, on scientific grounds, to prayer, and
  attempts to turn them by arguing that the proper objects of prayer are
  not physical but spiritual. He tells us that natural accidents and moral
  misfortunes are not to be taken <!-- Page 302 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page302"></a>{302}</span>for moral judgments of God; he admits the
  propriety of the application of scientific methods to the investigation
  of the origin and growth of religions; and he is as ready to recognise
  the process of evolution there, as in the physical world. Mark the
  following striking passage:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>And how utterly all the common objections to Divine revelation vanish
  away when they are set in the light of this theory of a spiritual
  progression. Are we reminded that there prevailed, in those earlier days,
  views of the nature of God and man, of human life and Divine Providence,
  which we now find to be untenable? <i>That</i>, we answer, is precisely
  what the theory of development presupposes. If early views of religion
  and morality had not been imperfect, where had been the development? If
  symbolical visions and mythical creations had found no place in the early
  Oriental expression of Divine truth, where had been the development? The
  sufficient answer to ninety-nine out of a hundred of the ordinary
  objections to the Bible, as the record of a divine education of our race,
  is asked in that one word&mdash;development. And to what are we indebted
  for that potent word, which, as with the wand of a magician, has at the
  same moment so completely transformed our knowledge and dispelled our
  difficulties? To modern science, resolutely pursuing its search for truth
  in spite of popular obloquy and&mdash;alas! that one should have to say
  it&mdash;in spite too often of theological denunciation (p. 53).</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>Apart from its general importance, I read this remarkable statement
  with the more pleasure, since, however imperfectly I may have endeavoured
  to illustrate the evolution of theology in a paper published in this
  Review last year, it seems to me that in principle, at any rate, I may
  hereafter claim high theological sanction for the views there set forth.
  <!-- Page 303 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page303"></a>{303}</span></p>

  <p>If theologians are henceforward prepared to recognise the authority of
  secular science in the manner and to the extent indicated in the
  Manchester trilogy; if the distinguished prelates who offer these terms
  are really plenipotentiaries, then, so far as I may presume to speak on
  such a matter, there will be no difficulty about concluding a perpetual
  treaty of peace, and indeed of alliance, between the high contracting
  powers, whose history has hitherto been little more than a record of
  continual warfare. But if the great Chancellor's maxim, "Do ut des," is
  to form the basis of negotiation, I am afraid that secular science will
  be ruined; for it seems to me that theology, under the generous impulse
  of a sudden conversion, has given all that she hath; and indeed, on one
  point, has surrendered more than can reasonably be asked.</p>

  <p>I suppose I must be prepared to face the reproach which attaches to
  those who criticise a gift, if I venture to observe that I do not think
  that the Bishop of Manchester need have been so much alarmed, as he
  evidently has been, by the objections which have often been raised to
  prayer, on the ground that a belief in the efficacy of prayer is
  inconsistent with a belief in the constancy of the order of nature.</p>

  <p>The Bishop appears to admit that there is an antagonism between the
  "regular economy of nature" and the "regular economy of prayer" (p. 39),
  and that "prayers for the interruption of God's natural order" are of
  "doubtful validity" (p. 42). It appears to me that the Bishop's
  difficulty simply adds another example to those which I have several
  times insisted <!-- Page 304 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page304"></a>{304}</span>upon in the pages of this Review and
  elsewhere, of the mischief which has been done, and is being done, by a
  mistaken apprehension of the real meaning of "natural order" and "law of
  nature."</p>

  <p>May I, therefore, be permitted to repeat, once more, that the
  statements denoted by these terms have no greater value or cogency than
  such as may attach to generalisations from experience of the past, and to
  expectations for the future based upon that experience? Nobody can
  presume to say what the order of nature must be; all that the widest
  experience (even if it extended over all past time and through all space)
  that events had happened in a certain way could justify, would be a
  proportionally strong expectation that events will go on so happening,
  and the demand for a proportional strength of evidence in favour of any
  assertion that they had happened otherwise.</p>

  <p>It is this weighty consideration, the truth of which every one who is
  capable of logical thought must surely admit, which knocks the bottom out
  of all <i>a priori</i> objections either to ordinary "miracles" or to the
  efficacy of prayer, in so far as the latter implies the miraculous
  intervention of a higher power. No one is entitled to say <i>a priori</i>
  that any given so-called miraculous event is impossible; and no one is
  entitled to say <i>a priori</i> that prayer for some change in the
  ordinary course of nature cannot possibly avail.</p>

  <p>The supposition that there is any inconsistency between the acceptance
  of the constancy of natural <!-- Page 305 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page305"></a>{305}</span>order and a belief in the efficacy of
  prayer, is the more unaccountable as it is obviously contradicted by
  analogies furnished by everyday experience. The belief in the efficacy of
  prayer depends upon the assumption that there is somebody, somewhere, who
  is strong enough to deal with the earth and its contents as men deal with
  the things and events which they are strong enough to modify or control;
  and who is capable of being moved by appeals such as men make to one
  another. This belief does not even involve theism; for our earth is an
  insignificant particle of the solar system, while the solar system is
  hardly worth speaking of in relation to the All; and, for anything that
  can be proved to the contrary, there may be beings endowed with full
  powers over our system, yet, practically, as insignificant as ourselves
  in relation to the universe. If any one pleases, therefore, to give
  unrestrained liberty to his fancy, he may plead analogy in favour of the
  dream that there may be, somewhere, a finite being, or beings, who can
  play with the solar system as a child plays with a toy; and that such
  being may be willing to do anything which he is properly supplicated to
  do. For we are not justified in saying that it is impossible for beings
  having the nature of men, only vastly more powerful, to exist; and if
  they do exist, they may act as and when we ask them to do so, just as our
  brother men act. As a matter of fact, the great mass of the human race
  has believed, and still believes, in such beings, under the various names
  of fairies, gnomes, angels, and demons. Certainly I do <!-- Page 306
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page306"></a>{306}</span>not lack faith
  in the constancy of natural order. But I am not less convinced that if I
  were to ask the Bishop of Manchester to do me a kindness which lay within
  his power, he would do it. And I am unable to see that his action on my
  request involves any violation of the order of nature. On the contrary,
  as I have not the honour to know the Bishop personally, my action would
  be based upon my faith in that "law of nature," or generalisation from
  experience, which tells me that, as a rule, men who occupy the Bishop's
  position are kindly and courteous. How is the case altered if my request
  is preferred to some imaginary superior being, or to the Most High Being,
  who, by the supposition, is able to arrest disease, or make the sun stand
  still in the heavens, just as easily as I can stop my watch, or make it
  indicate any hour that pleases me?</p>

  <p>I repeat that it is not upon any <i>a priori</i> considerations that
  objections, either to the supposed efficacy of prayer in modifying the
  course of events, or to the supposed occurrence of miracles, can be
  scientifically based. The real objection, and, to my mind, the fatal
  objection, to both these suppositions, is the inadequacy of the evidence
  to prove any given case of such occurrences which has been adduced. It is
  a canon of common sense, to say nothing of science, that the more
  improbable a supposed occurrence, the more cogent ought to be the
  evidence in its favour. I have looked somewhat carefully into the
  subject, and I am unable to find in the records of any miraculous event
  evidence <!-- Page 307 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page307"></a>{307}</span>which even approximates to the fulfilment
  of this requirement.</p>

  <p>But, in the case of prayer, the Bishop points out a most just and
  necessary distinction between its effect on the course of nature, outside
  ourselves, and its effect within the region of the supplicator's
  mind.</p>

  <p>It is a "law of nature," verifiable by everyday experience, that our
  already formed convictions, our strong desires, our intent occupation
  with particular ideas, modify our mental operations to a most marvellous
  extent, and produce enduring changes in the direction and in the
  intensity of our intellectual and moral activities. Men can intoxicate
  themselves with ideas as effectually as with alcohol or with bang, and
  produce, by dint of intense thinking, mental conditions hardly
  distinguishable from monomania. Demoniac possession is mythical; but the
  faculty of being possessed, more or less completely, by an idea is
  probably the fundamental condition of what is called genius, whether it
  show itself in the saint, the artist, or the man of science. One calls it
  faith, another calls it inspiration, a third calls it insight; but the
  "intending of the mind," to borrow Newton's well-known phrase, the
  concentration of all the rays of intellectual energy on some one point,
  until it glows and colours the whole cast of thought with its peculiar
  light, is common to all.</p>

  <p>I take it that the Bishop of Manchester has psychological science with
  him when he insists upon the subjective efficacy of prayer in faith, and
  on the <!-- Page 308 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page308"></a>{308}</span>seemingly miraculous effects which such
  "intending of the mind" upon religious and moral ideals may have upon
  character and happiness. Scientific faith, at present, takes it no
  further than the prayer which Ajax offered; but that petition is
  continually granted.</p>

  <p>Whatever points of detail may yet remain open for discussion, however,
  I repeat the opinion I have already expressed, that the Manchester
  sermons concede all that science has an indisputable right, or any
  pressing need, to ask, and that not grudgingly but generously; and, if
  the three bishops of 1887 carry the Church with them, I think they will
  have as good title to the permanent gratitude of posterity as the famous
  seven who went to the Tower in defence of the Church two hundred years
  ago.</p>

  <p>Will their brethren follow their just and prudent guidance? I have no
  such acquaintance with the currents of ecclesiastical opinion as would
  justify me in even hazarding a guess on such a difficult topic. But some
  recent omens are hardly favourable. There seems to be an impression
  abroad&mdash;I do not desire to give any countenance to it&mdash;that I
  am fond of reading sermons. From time to time, unknown
  correspondents&mdash;some apparently animated by the charitable desire to
  promote my conversion, and others unmistakably anxious to spur me to the
  expression of wrathful antagonism&mdash;favour me with reports or copies
  of such productions.</p>

  <p>I found one of the latter category among the accumulated arrears to
  which I have already referred.</p>

  <p>It is a full, and apparently accurate, report of a <!-- Page 309
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page309"></a>{309}</span>discourse by a
  person of no less ecclesiastical rank than the three authors of the
  sermons I have hitherto been considering; but who he is, and where or
  when the sermon was preached, are secrets which wild horses shall not
  tear from me, lest I fall again under high censure for attacking a
  clergyman. Only if the editor of this Review thinks it his duty to have
  independent evidence that the sermon has a real existence, will I, in the
  strictest confidence, communicate it to him.</p>

  <p>The preacher, in this case, is of a very different mind from the three
  bishops&mdash;and this mind is different in quality, different in spirit,
  and different in contents. He discourses on the <i>a priori</i>
  objections to miracles, apparently without being aware, in spite of all
  the discussions of the last seven or eight years, that he is doing battle
  with a shadow.</p>

  <p>I trust I do not misrepresent the Bishop of Manchester in saying that
  the essence of his remarkable discourse is the insistence upon the
  "supreme importance of the purely spiritual in our faith," and of the
  relative, if not absolute, insignificance of aught else. He obviously
  perceives the bearing of his arguments against the alterability of the
  course of outward nature by prayer, on the question of miracles in
  general; for he is careful to say that "the possibility of miracles, of a
  rare and unusual transcendence of the world order is not here in
  question" (p. 38). It may be permitted me to suppose, however, that, if
  miracles were in question, the speaker who warns us "that we must look
  for the heart of the absolute <!-- Page 310 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page310"></a>{310}</span>religion in that part of it which
  prescribes our moral and religious relations" (p. 46) would not be
  disposed to advise those who had found the heart of Christianity to take
  much thought about its miraculous integument.</p>

  <p>My anonymous sermon will have nothing to do with such notions as
  these, and its preacher is not too polite, to say nothing of charitable,
  towards those who entertain them.</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>Scientific men, therefore, are perfectly right in asserting that
  Christianity rests on miracles. If miracles never happened, Christianity,
  in any sense which is not a mockery, which does not make the term of none
  effect, has no reality. I dwell on this because there is now an effort
  making to get up a non-miraculous, invertebrate Christianity, which may
  escape the ban of science. And I would warn you very distinctly against
  this new contrivance. Christianity is essentially miraculous, and falls
  to the ground if miracles be impossible.</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>Well, warning for warning. I venture to warn this preacher and those
  who, with him, persist in identifying Christianity with the miraculous,
  that such forms of Christianity are not only doomed to fall to the
  ground; but that, within the last half century, they have been driving
  that way with continually accelerated velocity.</p>

  <p>The so-called religious world is given to a strange delusion. It
  fondly imagines that it possesses the monopoly of serious and constant
  reflection upon the terrible problems of existence; and that those who
  cannot accept its shibboleths are either mere Gallios, caring for none of
  these things, or libertines desiring to escape from the restraints of
  morality. It does not <!-- Page 311 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page311"></a>{311}</span>appear to have entered the imaginations of
  these people that, outside their pale and firmly resolved never to enter
  it, there are thousands of men, certainly not their inferiors in
  character, capacity, or knowledge of the questions at issue, who estimate
  those purely spiritual elements of the Christian faith of which the
  Bishop of Manchester speaks as highly as the Bishop does; but who will
  have nothing to do with the Christian Churches, because in their
  apprehension and for them, the profession of belief in the miraculous, on
  the evidence offered, would be simply immoral.</p>

  <p>So far as my experience goes, men of science are neither better nor
  worse than the rest of the world. Occupation with the endlessly great
  parts of the universe does not necessarily involve greatness of
  character, nor does microscopic study of the infinitely little always
  produce humility. We have our full share of original sin; need, greed,
  and vainglory beset us as they do other mortals; and our progress is, for
  the most part, like that of a tacking ship, the resultant of opposite
  divergencies from the straight path. But, for all that, there is one
  moral benefit which the pursuit of science unquestionably bestows. It
  keeps the estimate of the value of evidence up to the proper mark; and we
  are constantly receiving lessons, and sometimes very sharp ones, on the
  nature of proof. Men of science will always act up to their standard of
  veracity, when mankind in general leave off sinning; but that standard
  appears to me to be higher among them than in any other class of the
  community. <!-- Page 312 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page312"></a>{312}</span></p>

  <p>I do not know any body of scientific men who could be got to listen
  without the strongest expressions of disgusted repudiation to the
  exposition of a pretended scientific discovery, which had no better
  evidence to show for itself than the story of the devils entering a herd
  of swine, or of the fig-tree that was blasted for bearing no figs when
  "it was not the season of figs." Whether such events are possible or
  impossible, no man can say; but scientific ethics can and does declare
  that the profession of belief in them, on the evidence of documents of
  unknown date and of unknown authorship, is immoral. Theological
  apologists who insist that morality will vanish if their dogmas are
  exploded, would do well to consider the fact that, in the matter of
  intellectual veracity, science is already a long way ahead of the
  Churches; and that, in this particular, it is exerting an educational
  influence on mankind of which the Churches have shown themselves utterly
  incapable.</p>

  <p>Undoubtedly that varying compound of some of the best and some of the
  worst elements of Paganism and Judaism, moulded in practice by the innate
  character of certain people of the Western world, which, since the second
  century, has assumed to itself the title of orthodox Christianity, "rests
  on miracles" and falls to the ground, not "if miracles be impossible,"
  but if those to whom it is committed prove themselves unable to fulfil
  the conditions of honest belief. That this Christianity is doomed to fall
  is, to my mind, beyond a doubt; but its fall will be neither sudden nor
  speedy. The Church, with all the aid <!-- Page 313 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page313"></a>{313}</span>lent it by the secular
  arm, took many centuries to extirpate the open practice of pagan idolatry
  within its own fold; and those who have travelled in southern Europe will
  be aware that it has not extirpated the essence of such idolatry even
  yet. <i>Mutato nomine</i>, it is probable that there is as much sheer
  fetichism among the Roman populace now as there was eighteen hundred
  years ago; and if Marcus Antoninus could descend from his horse and
  ascend the steps of the Ara C&oelig;li church about Twelfth Day, the only
  thing that need strike him would be the extremely contemptible character
  of the modern idols as works of art.</p>

  <p>Science will certainly neither ask for, nor receive, the aid of the
  secular arm. It will trust to the much better and more powerful help of
  that education in scientific truth and in the morals of assent, which is
  rendered as indispensable, as it is inevitable, by the permeation of
  practical life with the products and ideas of science. But no one who
  considers the present state of even the most developed countries can
  doubt that the scientific light that has come into the world will, for a
  long time, have to shine in the midst of darkness. The urban populations,
  driven into contact with science by trade and manufacture, will more and
  more receive it, while the <i>pagani</i> will lag behind. Let us hope
  that no Julian may arise among them to head a forlorn hope against the
  inevitable. Whatever happens, science may bide her time in patience and
  in confidence.</p>

  <p>But to return to my "Anonymous." I am afraid <!-- Page 314 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page314"></a>{314}</span>that if he represents
  any great party in the Church, the spirit of justice and reasonableness
  which animates the three bishops has as slender a chance of being
  imitated, on a large scale, as their common sense and their courtesy.
  For, not contented with misrepresenting science on its speculative side,
  "Anonymous" attacks its morality.</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>For two whole years, investigations and conclusions which would upset
  the theories of Darwin on the formation of coral islands were actually
  suppressed, and that by the advice even of those who accepted them,
  <i>for fear of upsetting the faith and disturbing the judgment formed by
  the multitude on the scientific character&mdash;the
  infallibility&mdash;of the great master!</i></p>

</blockquote>

  <p>So far as I know anything about the matters which are here referred
  to, the part of this passage which I have italicised is absolutely
  untrue. I believe that I am intimately acquainted with all Mr. Darwin's
  immediate scientific friends; and I say that no one of them, nor any
  other man of science known to me, ever could, or would, have given such
  advice to any one&mdash;if for no other reason than that, with the
  example of the most candid and patient listener to objections that ever
  lived fresh in their memories, they could not so grossly have at once
  violated their highest duty and dishonoured their friend.</p>

  <p>The charge thus brought by "Anonymous" affects the honour and the
  probity of men of science; if it is true, we have forfeited all claim to
  the confidence of the general public. In my belief it is utterly false,
  and its real effect will be to discredit those who are responsible for
  it. As is the way with slanders, it <!-- Page 315 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page315"></a>{315}</span>has grown by
  repetition. "Anonymous" is responsible for the peculiarly offensive form
  which it has taken in his hands; but he is not responsible for
  originating it. He has evidently been inspired by an article entitled "A
  Great Lesson," published in the September number of this Review. Truly it
  is "a great lesson," but not quite in the sense intended by the giver
  thereof.</p>

  <p>In the course of his doubtless well-meant admonitions, the Duke of
  Argyll commits himself to a greater number of statements which are
  demonstrably incorrect, and which any one who ventured to write upon the
  subject ought to have known to be incorrect, than I have ever seen
  gathered together in so small a space.</p>

  <p>I submit a gathering from the rich store for the appreciation of the
  public.</p>

  <p>First:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>Mr. Murray's new explanation of the structure of coral-reefs and
  islands was communicated to the Royal Society of Edinburgh in 1880, and
  supported with such a weight of facts and such a close texture of
  reasoning, that no serious reply has ever been attempted (p. 305).</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>"No serious reply has ever been attempted"! I suppose that the Duke of
  Argyll may have heard of Professor Dana, whose years of labour devoted to
  corals and coral-reefs when he was naturalist of the American expedition
  under Commodore Wilkes, more than forty years ago, have ever since caused
  him to be recognised as an authority of the first rank on such subjects.
  Now does his Grace know, or does he not <!-- Page 316 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page316"></a>{316}</span>know, that, in the year
  1885, Professor Dana published an elaborate paper "On the Origin of
  Coral-Reefs and Islands," in which, after referring to a presidential
  address by the Director of the Geological Survey of Great Britain and
  Ireland delivered in 1883, in which special attention is directed to Mr.
  Murray's views, Professor Dana says:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>The existing state of doubt on the question has led the writer to
  reconsider the earlier and later facts, and in the following pages he
  gives his results.</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>Professor Dana then devotes many pages of his very "serious reply" to
  a most admirable and weighty criticism of the objections which have at
  various times been raised to Mr. Darwin's doctrine, by Professor Semper,
  by Dr. Rein, and finally by Mr. Murray, and he states his final judgment
  as follows:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>With the theory of abrasion and solution incompetent, all the
  hypotheses of objectors to Darwin's theory are alike weak; for all have
  made these processes their chief reliance, whether appealing to a
  calcareous, or a volcanic, or a mountain-peak basement for the structure.
  The subsidence which the Darwinian theory requires has not been opposed
  by the mention of any fact at variance with it, nor by setting aside
  Darwin's arguments in its favour; and it has found new support in the
  facts from the <i>Challenger's</i> soundings off Tahiti, that had been
  put in array against it, and strong corroboration in the facts from the
  West Indies.</p>

  <p>Darwin's theory, therefore, remains as the theory that accounts for
  the origin of reefs and islands.<a name="NtA77"
  href="#Nt77"><sup>[77]</sup></a></p>

</blockquote>

  <p>Be it understood that I express no opinion on the controverted points.
  I doubt if there are ten living men who, having a practical knowledge of
  what a <!-- Page 317 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page317"></a>{317}</span>coral-reef is, have endeavoured to master
  the very difficult biological and geological problems involved in their
  study. I happen to have spent the best part of three years among
  coral-reefs and to have made that attempt; and, when Mr. Murray's work
  appeared, I said to myself that until I had two or three months to give
  to the renewed study of the subject in all its bearings, I must be
  content to remain in a condition of suspended judgment. In the meanwhile,
  the man who would be voted by common acclamation as the most competent
  person now living to act as umpire, has delivered the verdict I have
  quoted; and, to go no further, has fully justified the hesitation I and
  others may have felt about expressing an opinion. Under these
  circumstances, it seems to me to require a good deal of courage to say
  "no serious reply has ever been attempted"; and to chide the men of
  science, in lofty tones, for their "reluctance to admit an error" which
  is not admitted; and for their "slow and sulky acquiescence" in a
  conclusion which they have the gravest warranty for suspecting!</p>

  <p>Second:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>Darwin himself had lived to hear of the new solution, and, with that
  splendid candour which was eminent in him, his mind, though now grown old
  in his own early convictions, was at least ready to entertain it, and to
  confess that serious doubts had been awakened as to the truth of his
  famous theory (p. 305).</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>I wish that Darwin's splendid candour could be conveyed by some
  description of spiritual "microbe" to those who write about him. I am not
  aware that Mr. Darwin ever entertained "serious doubts as to <!-- Page
  318 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page318"></a>{318}</span>the truth
  of his famous theory"; and there is tolerably good evidence to the
  contrary. The second edition of his work, published in 1876, proves that
  he entertained no such doubts then; a letter to Professor Semper, whose
  objections, in some respects, forestalled those of Mr. Murray, dated
  October 2, 1879, expresses his continued adherence to the opinion "that
  the atolls and barrier reefs in the middle of the Pacific and Indian
  Oceans indicate subsidence"; and the letter of my friend Professor Judd,
  printed at the end of this article (which I had perhaps better say
  Professor Judd had not seen) will prove that this opinion remained
  unaltered to the end of his life.</p>

  <p>Third:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>... Darwin's theory is a dream. It is not only unsound, but it is in
  many respects the reverse of truth. With all his conscientiousness, with
  all his caution, with all his powers of observation, Darwin in this
  matter fell into errors as profound as the abysses of the Pacific (p.
  301).</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>Really? It seems to me that, under the circumstances, it is pretty
  clear that these lines exhibit a lack of the qualities justly ascribed to
  Mr. Darwin, which plunges their author into a much deeper abyss, and one
  from which there is no hope of emergence.</p>

  <p>Fourth:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>All the acclamations with which it was received were as the shouts of
  an ignorant mob (p. 301).</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>But surely it should be added that the Coryphæus of this ignorant mob,
  the fugleman of the shouts, was one of the most accomplished naturalists
  and geologists now living&mdash;the American Dana&mdash;who, after years
  of <!-- Page 319 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page319"></a>{319}</span>independent study extending over numerous
  reefs in the Pacific, gave his hearty assent to Darwin's views, and,
  after all that had been said, deliberately reaffirmed that assent in the
  year 1885.</p>

  <p>Fifth:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>The overthrow of Darwin's speculation is only beginning to be known.
  It has been whispered for some time. The cherished dogma has been
  dropping very slowly out of sight (p. 301).</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>Darwin's speculation may be right or wrong, but I submit that that
  which has not happened cannot even begin to be known, except by those who
  have miraculous gifts to which we poor scientific people do not aspire.
  The overthrow of Darwin's views may have been whispered by those who
  hoped for it; and they were perhaps wise in not raising their voices
  above a whisper. Incorrect statements, if made too loudly, are apt to
  bring about unpleasant consequences.</p>

  <p>Sixth. Mr. Murray's views, published in 1880, are said to have met
  with "slow and sulky acquiescence" (p. 305). I have proved that they
  cannot be said to have met with general acquiescence of any sort, whether
  quick and cheerful, or slow and sulky; and if this assertion is meant to
  convey the impression that Mr. Murray's views have been ignored, that
  there has been a conspiracy of silence against them, it is utterly
  contrary to notorious fact.</p>

  <p>Professor Geikie's well-known <i>Textbook of Geology</i> was published
  in 1882, and at pages 457-459 of that work there is a careful exposition
  of Mr. Murray's views. Moreover, Professor Geikie has specially <!-- Page
  320 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page320"></a>{320}</span>advocated
  them on other occasions,<a name="NtA78" href="#Nt78"><sup>[78]</sup></a>
  notably in a long article on "The Origin of Coral-Reefs," published in
  two numbers of <i>Nature</i> for 1883, and in a presidential address
  delivered in the same year. If, in so short a time after the publication
  of his views, Mr. Murray could boast of a convert so distinguished and
  influential as the Director of the Geological Survey, it seems to me that
  this wonderful <i>conspiration de silence</i> (which has about as much
  real existence as the Duke of Argyll's other bogie, "the Reign of
  Terror") must have <i>ipso facto</i> collapsed. I wish that, when I was a
  young man, my endeavours to upset some prevalent errors had met with as
  speedy and effectual backing.</p>

  <p>Seventh:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>... Mr. John Murray was strongly advised against the publication of
  his views in derogation of Darwin's long-accepted theory of the coral
  islands, and was actually induced to delay it for two years. Yet the late
  Sir Wyville Thomson, who was at the head of the naturalists of the
  <i>Challenger</i> expedition, was himself convinced by Mr. Murray's
  reasoning (p. 307).</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>Clearly, then, it could not be Mr. Murray's official chief who gave
  him this advice. Who was it? And what was the exact nature of the advice
  given? Until we have some precise information on this head, I shall take
  leave to doubt whether this statement is more accurate than those which I
  have previously cited.</p>

  <p>Whether such advice was wise or foolish, just or <!-- Page 321
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page321"></a>{321}</span>immoral,
  depends entirely on the motive of the person who gave it. If he meant to
  suggest to Mr. Murray that it might be wise for a young and comparatively
  unknown man to walk warily, when he proposed to attack a generalisation
  based on many years' labour of one undoubtedly competent person, and
  fortified by the independent results of the many years' labour of another
  undoubtedly competent person; and even, if necessary, to take two whole
  years in fortifying his position, I think that such advice would have
  been sagacious and kind. I suppose that there are few working men of
  science who have not kept their ideas to themselves, while gathering and
  sifting evidence, for a much longer period than two years.</p>

  <p>If, on the other hand, Mr. Murray was advised to delay the publication
  of his criticisms, simply to save Mr. Darwin's credit and to preserve
  some reputation for infallibility, which no one ever heard of, then I
  have no hesitation in declaring that his adviser was profoundly
  dishonest, as well as extremely foolish, and that, if he is a man of
  science, he has disgraced his calling.</p>

  <p>But, after all, this supposed scientific Achitophel has not yet made
  good the primary fact of his existence. Until the needful proof is
  forthcoming, I think I am justified in suspending my judgment as to
  whether he is much more than an anti-scientific myth. I leave it to the
  Duke of Argyll to judge of the extent of the obligation under which, for
  his own sake, he may lie to produce the evidence on which <!-- Page 322
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page322"></a>{322}</span>his aspersions
  of the honour of scientific men are based. I cannot pretend that we are
  seriously disturbed by charges which every one who is acquainted with the
  truth of the matter knows to be ridiculous; but mud has a habit of
  staining if it lies too long, and it is as well to have it brushed off as
  soon as may be.</p>

  <p>So much for the "Great Lesson." It is followed by a "Little Lesson,"
  apparently directed against my infallibility&mdash;a doctrine about which
  I should be inclined to paraphrase Wilkes's remark to George the Third,
  when he declared that he, at any rate, was not a Wilkite. But I really
  should be glad to think that there are people who need the warning,
  because then it will be obvious that this raking up of an old story
  cannot have been suggested by a mere fanatical desire to damage men of
  science. I can but rejoice, then, that these misguided enthusiasts, whose
  faith in me has so far exceeded the bounds of reason, should be set
  right. But that "want of finish" in the matter of accuracy which so
  terribly mars the effect of the "Great Lesson," is no less conspicuous in
  the case of the "Little Lesson," and, instead of setting my too fervent
  disciples right, it will set them wrong.</p>

  <p>The Duke of Argyll, in telling the story of <i>Bathybius</i>, says
  that my mind was "caught by this new and grand generalisation of the
  physical basis of life." I never have been guilty of a reclamation about
  anything to my credit, and I do not mean to be; but if there is any blame
  going, I do not choose to be relegated to a subordinate place when I have
  a claim to <!-- Page 323 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page323"></a>{323}</span>the first. The responsibility for the
  first description and the naming of <i>Bathybius</i> is mine and mine
  only. The paper on "Some Organisms living at great depths in the Atlantic
  Ocean," in which I drew attention to this substance, is to be found by
  the curious in the 8th volume of the <i>Quarterly Journal of
  Microscopical Science</i>, and was published in the year 1868. Whatever
  errors are contained in that paper are my own peculiar property; but
  neither at the meeting of the British Association in 1868, nor anywhere
  else, have I gone beyond what is there stated; except in so far that, at
  a long-subsequent meeting of the Association, being importuned about the
  subject, I ventured to express, somewhat emphatically, the wish that the
  thing was at the bottom of the sea.</p>

  <p>What is meant by my being caught by a generalisation about the
  physical basis of life I do not know; still less can I understand the
  assertion that <i>Bathybius</i> was accepted because of its supposed
  harmony with Darwin's speculations. That which interested me in the
  matter was the apparent analogy of <i>Bathybius</i> with other well-known
  forms of lower life, such as the plasmodia of the Myxomycetes and the
  Rhizopods. Speculative hopes or fears had nothing to do with the matter;
  and if <i>Bathybius</i> were brought up alive from the bottom of the
  Atlantic to-morrow, the fact would not have the slightest bearing, that I
  can discern, upon Mr. Darwin's speculations, or upon any of the disputed
  problems of biology. It would merely be one elementary organism the more
  added to the thousands already known. <!-- Page 324 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page324"></a>{324}</span></p>

  <p>Up to this moment I was not aware of the universal favour with which
  <i>Bathybius</i> was received.<a name="NtA79"
  href="#Nt79"><sup>[79]</sup></a> Those simulators of an "ignorant mob"
  who, according to the Duke of Argyll, welcomed Darwin's theory of
  coral-reefs, made no demonstration in my favour, unless his Grace
  includes Sir Wyville Thomson, Dr. Carpenter, Dr. Bessels, and Professor
  Haeckel under that head. On the contrary, a sagacious friend of mine,
  than whom there was no more competent judge, the late Mr. George Busk,
  was not to be converted; while, long before the <i>Challenger</i> work,
  Ehrenberg wrote to me very sceptically; and I fully expected that that
  eminent man would favour me with pretty sharp criticism. Unfortunately he
  died shortly afterwards, and nothing from him, that I know of, appeared.
  When Sir Wyville Thomson wrote to me a brief account of the results
  obtained on board the <i>Challenger</i>, I sent his statement to
  <i>Nature</i>, in which journal it appeared the following week, without
  any further note or comment than was needful to explain the
  circumstances. In thus allowing judgment to go by default, I am afraid I
  showed a reckless and ungracious disregard for the feelings of the
  believers in my infallibility. No doubt I ought to have hedged and fenced
  and attenuated the effect of Sir Wyville Thomson's brief note in every
  possible way. Or <!-- Page 325 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page325"></a>{325}</span>perhaps I ought to have suppressed the
  note altogether, on the ground that it was a mere <i>ex parte</i>
  statement. My excuse is that, notwithstanding a large and abiding faith
  in human folly, I did not know then, any more than I know now, that there
  was anybody foolish enough to be unaware that the only people, scientific
  or other, who never make mistakes are those who do nothing; or that
  anybody, for whose opinion I cared, would not rather see me commit ten
  blunders than try to hide one.</p>

  <p>Pending the production of further evidence, I hold that the existence
  of people who believe in the infallibility of men of science is as purely
  mythical as that of the evil counsellor who advised the withholding of
  the truth lest it should conflict with that belief.</p>

  <p>I venture to think, then, that the Duke of Argyll might have spared
  his "Little Lesson" as well as his "Great Lesson" with advantage. The
  paternal authority who whips the child for sins he has not committed does
  not strengthen his moral influence&mdash;rather excites contempt and
  repugnance. And if, as would seem from this and former monitory
  allocutions which have been addressed to us, the Duke aspires to the
  position of censor, or spiritual director, in relation to the men who are
  doing the work of physical science, he really must get up his facts
  better. There will be an end to all chance of our kissing the rod if his
  Grace goes wrong a third time. He must not say again that "no serious
  reply has been attempted" to a view which was discussed and <!-- Page 326
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page326"></a>{326}</span>repudiated,
  two years before, by one of the highest extant authorities on the
  subject; he must not say that Darwin accepted that which it can be proved
  he did not accept; he must not say that a doctrine has dropped into the
  abyss when it is quite obviously alive and kicking at the surface; he
  must not assimilate a man like Professor Dana to the components of an
  "ignorant mob"; he must not say that things are beginning to be known
  which are not known at all; he must not say that "slow and sulky
  acquiescence" has been given to that which cannot yet boast of general
  acquiescence of any kind; he must not suggest that a view which has been
  publicly advocated by the Director of the Geological Survey and no less
  publicly discussed by many other authoritative writers has been
  intentionally and systematically ignored; he must not ascribe ill motives
  for a course of action which is the only proper one; and finally, if any
  one but myself were interested, I should say that he had better not waste
  his time in raking up the errors of those whose lives have been occupied,
  not in talking about science, but in toiling, sometimes with success and
  sometimes with failure, to get some real work done.</p>

  <p>The most considerable difference I note among men is not in their
  readiness to fall into error, but in their readiness to acknowledge these
  inevitable lapses. The Duke of Argyll has now a splendid opportunity for
  proving to the world in which of these categories it is hereafter to rank
  him.</p>

  <p><br style="clear:both" /></p>
<hr class="short" />

<p><!-- Page 327 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page327"></a>{327}</span></p>

  <p><span class="sc">Dear Professor Huxley</span>&mdash;A short time
  before Mr. Darwin's death, I had a conversation with him concerning the
  observations which had been made by Mr. Murray upon coral-reefs, and the
  speculations which had been founded upon those observations. I found that
  Mr. Darwin had very carefully considered the whole subject, and that
  while, on the one hand, he did not regard the actual facts recorded by
  Mr. Murray as absolutely inconsistent with his own theory of subsidence,
  on the other hand, he did not believe that they necessitated or supported
  the hypothesis advanced by Mr. Murray. Mr. Darwin's attitude, as I
  understood it, towards Mr. Murray's objections to the theory of
  subsidence was exactly similar to that maintained by him with respect to
  Professor Semper's criticism, which was of a very similar character; and
  his position with regard to the whole question was almost identical with
  that subsequently so clearly defined by Professor Dana in his well-known
  articles published in the <i>American Journal of Science</i> for
  1885.</p>

  <p>It is difficult to imagine how any one, acquainted with the scientific
  literature of the last seven years, could possibly suggest that Mr.
  Murray's memoir published in 1880 had failed to secure a due amount of
  attention. Mr. Murray, by his position in the <i>Challenger</i> office,
  occupied an exceptionally favourable position for making his views widely
  known; and he had, moreover, the singular good fortune to secure from the
  first the advocacy of so able and brilliant a writer as Professor
  Archibald Geikie, who <!-- Page 328 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page328"></a>{328}</span>in a special discourse and in several
  treatises on geology and physical geology very strongly supported the new
  theory. It would be an endless task to attempt to give references to the
  various scientific journals which have discussed the subject, but I may
  add that every treatise on geology which has been published, since Mr.
  Murray's views were made known, has dealt with his observations at
  considerable length. This is true of Professor A.&nbsp;H. Green's <i>Physical
  Geology</i>, published in 1882; of Professor Prestwich's <i>Geology,
  Chemical and Physical</i>; and of Professor James Geikie's <i>Outlines of
  Geology</i>, published in 1886. Similar prominence is given to the
  subject in De Lapparent's <i>Traité de Géologie</i>, published in 1885,
  and in Credner's <i>Elemente der Geologie</i>, which has appeared during
  the present year. If this be a "conspiracy of silence," where, alas! can
  the geological speculator seek for fame?&mdash;Yours very truly,</p>

<h3>IX</h3>

<h3>AGNOSTICISM</h3>

  <p>Within the last few months the public has received much and varied
  information on the subject of agnostics, their tenets, and even their
  future. Agnosticism exercised the orators of the Church Congress at
  Manchester.<a name="NtA80" href="#Nt80"><sup>[80]</sup></a> It has been
  furnished with a set of "articles" fewer, but not less rigid, and
  certainly not less consistent than the thirty-nine; its nature has been
  analysed, and its future severely predicted by the most eloquent of that
  prophetical school whose Samuel is Auguste Comte. It may still be a
  question, however, whether the public is as much the wiser as might be
  expected, considering all the trouble that has been taken to enlighten
  it. Not only are the three accounts of the agnostic position sadly out of
  harmony with one another, but I propose to show cause for my belief that
  all three must be seriously questioned by any one who employs the term
  "agnostic" in the sense in which it was originally used. The learned
  Principal of King's College, who brought <!-- Page 330 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page330"></a>{330}</span>the topic of
  Agnosticism before the Church Congress, took a short and easy way of
  settling the business:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>But if this be so, for a man to urge, as an escape from this article
  of belief, that he has no means of a scientific knowledge of the unseen
  world, or of the future, is irrelevant. His difference from Christians
  lies not in the fact that he has no knowledge of these things, but that
  he does not believe the authority on which they are stated. He may prefer
  to call himself an Agnostic; but his real name is an older one&mdash;he
  is an infidel; that is to say, an unbeliever. The word infidel, perhaps,
  carries an unpleasant significance. Perhaps it is right that it should.
  It is, and it ought to be, an unpleasant thing for a man to have to say
  plainly that he does not believe in Jesus Christ.<a name="NtA81"
  href="#Nt81"><sup>[81]</sup></a></p>

</blockquote>

  <p>So much of Dr. Wace's address either explicitly or implicitly concerns
  me, that I take upon myself to deal with it; but, in so doing, it must be
  understood that I speak for myself alone. I am not aware that there is
  any sect of Agnostics; and if there be, I am not its acknowledged prophet
  or pope. I desire to leave to the Comtists the entire monopoly of the
  manufacture of imitation ecclesiasticism.</p>

  <p>Let us calmly and dispassionately consider Dr. Wace's appreciation of
  agnosticism. The agnostic, according to his view, is a person who says he
  has no means of attaining a scientific knowledge of the unseen world or
  of the future; by which somewhat loose <!-- Page 331 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page331"></a>{331}</span>phraseology Dr. Wace
  presumably means the theological unseen world and future. I cannot think
  this description happy, either in form or substance, but for the present
  it may pass. Dr. Wace continues, that is not "his difference from
  Christians." Are there then any Christians who say that they know nothing
  about the unseen world and the future? I was ignorant of the fact, but I
  am ready to accept it on the authority of a professional theologian, and
  I proceed to Dr. Wace's next proposition.</p>

  <p>The real state of the case, then, is that the agnostic "does not
  believe the authority" on which "these things" are stated, which
  authority is Jesus Christ. He is simply an old-fashioned "infidel" who is
  afraid to own to his right name. As "Presbyter is priest writ large," so
  is "agnostic" the mere Greek equivalent for the Latin "infidel." There is
  an attractive simplicity about this solution of the problem; and it has
  that advantage of being somewhat offensive to the persons attacked, which
  is so dear to the less refined sort of controversialist. The agnostic
  says, "I cannot find good evidence that so and so is true." "Ah," says
  his adversary, seizing his opportunity, "then you declare that Jesus
  Christ was untruthful, for he said so and so;" a very telling method of
  rousing prejudice. But suppose that the value of the evidence as to what
  Jesus may have said and done, and as to the exact nature and scope of his
  authority, is just that which the agnostic finds it most difficult to
  determine. If I venture to doubt that the Duke of Wellington gave the
  command "Up, Guards, <!-- Page 332 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page332"></a>{332}</span>and at 'em!" at Waterloo, I do not think
  that even Dr. Wace would accuse me of disbelieving the Duke. Yet it would
  be just as reasonable to do this as to accuse any one of denying what
  Jesus said before the preliminary question as to what he did say is
  settled.</p>

  <p>Now, the question as to what Jesus really said and did is strictly a
  scientific problem, which is capable of solution by no other methods than
  those practised by the historian and the literary critic. It is a problem
  of immense difficulty, which has occupied some of the best heads in
  Europe for the last century; and it is only of late years that their
  investigations have begun to converge towards one conclusion.<a
  name="NtA82" href="#Nt82"><sup>[82]</sup></a></p>

  <p>That kind of faith which Dr. Wace describes and lauds is of no use
  here. Indeed, he himself takes pains to destroy its evidential value.</p>

  <p>"What made the Mahommedan world? Trust and faith in the declarations
  and assurances of Mahommed. And what made the Christian world? Trust and
  <!-- Page 333 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page333"></a>{333}</span>faith in the declarations and assurances
  of Jesus Christ and His Apostles" (<i>l. c.</i> p. 253). The triumphant
  tone of this imaginary catechism leads me to suspect that its author has
  hardly appreciated its full import. Presumably, Dr. Wace regards Mahommed
  as an unbeliever, or, to use the term which he prefers, infidel; and
  considers that his assurances have given rise to a vast delusion which
  has led, and is leading, millions of men straight to everlasting
  punishment. And this being so, the "Trust and faith" which have "made the
  Mahommedan world," in just the same sense as they have "made the
  Christian world," must be trust and faith in falsehood. No man who has
  studied history, or even attended to the occurrences of everyday life,
  can doubt the enormous practical value of trust and faith; but as little
  will he be inclined to deny that this practical value has not the least
  relation to the reality of the objects of that trust and faith. In
  examples of patient constancy of faith and of unswerving trust, the
  <i>Acta Martyrum</i> do not excel the annals of Babism.<a name="NtA83"
  href="#Nt83"><sup>[83]</sup></a></p>

  <p>&nbsp;</p>

  <p>The discussion upon which we have now entered goes so thoroughly to
  the root of the whole matter; the question of the day is so completely,
  as the author of <i>Robert Elsmere</i> says, the value of testimony, that
  I shall offer no apology for following it out somewhat in detail; and, by
  way of giving substance to the <!-- Page 334 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page334"></a>{334}</span>argument, I shall base what I have to say
  upon a case, the consideration of which lies strictly within the province
  of natural science, and of that particular part of it known as the
  physiology and pathology of the nervous system.</p>

  <p>I find, in the second Gospel (chap. v.), a statement, to all
  appearance intended to have the same evidential value as any other
  contained in that history. It is the well-known story of the devils who
  were cast out of a man, and ordered, or permitted, to enter into a herd
  of swine, to the great loss and damage of the innocent Gerasene, or
  Gadarene, pig owners. There can be no doubt that the narrator intends to
  convey to his readers his own conviction that this casting out and
  entering in were effected by the agency of Jesus of Nazareth; that, by
  speech and action, Jesus enforced this conviction; nor does any inkling
  of the legal and moral difficulties of the case manifest itself.</p>

  <p>On the other hand, everything that I know of physiological and
  pathological science leads me to entertain a very strong conviction that
  the phenomena ascribed to possession are as purely natural as those which
  constitute small-pox; everything that I know of anthropology leads me to
  think that the belief in demons and demoniacal possession is a mere
  survival of a once universal superstition, and that its persistence, at
  the present time, is pretty much in the inverse ratio of the general
  instruction, intelligence, and sound judgment of the population among
  whom it prevails. Everything that I know of law and <!-- Page 335
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page335"></a>{335}</span>justice
  convinces me that the wanton destruction of other people's property is a
  misdemeanour of evil example. Again, the study of history, and especially
  of that of the fifteenth, sixteenth, and seventeenth centuries, leaves no
  shadow of doubt on my mind that the belief in the reality of possession
  and of witchcraft, justly based, alike by Catholics and Protestants, upon
  this and innumerable other passages in both the Old and New Testaments,
  gave rise, through the special influence of Christian ecclesiastics, to
  the most horrible persecutions and judicial murders of thousands upon
  thousands of innocent men, women, and children. And when I reflect that
  the record of a plain and simple declaration upon such an occasion as
  this, that the belief in witchcraft and possession is wicked nonsense,
  would have rendered the long agony of mediæval humanity impossible, I am
  prompted to reject, as dishonouring, the supposition that such
  declaration was withheld out of condescension to popular error.</p>

  <p>"Come forth, thou unclean spirit, out of the man" (Mark v. 8),<a
  name="NtA84" href="#Nt84"><sup>[84]</sup></a> are the words attributed to
  Jesus. If I declare, as I have no hesitation in doing, that I utterly
  disbelieve in the existence of "unclean spirits," and, consequently, in
  the possibility of their "coming forth" out of a man, I suppose that Dr.
  Wace will tell me I am disregarding the testimony "of our Lord" (<i>l.
  c.</i> p. 255). For if these words were really used, the most resourceful
  of reconcilers can hardly venture to affirm that they are compatible with
  a disbelief in "these things." As the learned and <!-- Page 336 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page336"></a>{336}</span>fair-minded, as well as
  orthodox, Dr. Alexander remarks, in an editorial note to the article
  "Demoniacs," in the <i>Biblical Cyclopædia</i> (vol. i. p. 664,
  note):&mdash;</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>... On the lowest grounds on which our Lord and His Apostles can be
  placed they must, at least, be regarded as <i>honest</i> men. Now, though
  honest speech does not require that words should be used always and only
  in their etymological sense, it does require that they should not be used
  so as to affirm what the speaker knows to be false. Whilst, therefore,
  our Lord and His Apostles might use the word <span title="daimonizesthai" class="grk"
  >&delta;&alpha;&iota;&mu;&omicron;&nu;&#x1F77;&zeta;&epsilon;&sigma;&theta;&alpha;&iota;</span>,
  or the phrase <span title="daimonion echein" class="grk"
  >&delta;&alpha;&iota;&mu;&#x1F79;&nu;&iota;&omicron;&nu;
  &#x1F14;&chi;&epsilon;&iota;&nu;</span>, as a popular description of
  certain diseases, without giving in to the belief which lay at the source
  of such a mode of expression, they could not speak of demons entering
  into a man, or being cast out of him, without pledging themselves to the
  belief of an actual possession of the man by the demons. (Campbell,
  <i>Prel. Diss.</i> vi. 1, 10.) If, consequently, they did not hold this
  belief, they spoke not as honest men.</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>The story which we are considering does not rest on the authority of
  the second Gospel alone. The third confirms the second, especially in the
  matter of commanding the unclean spirit to come out of the man (Luke
  viii. 29); and, although the first Gospel either gives a different
  version of the same story, or tells another of like kind, the essential
  point remains: "If thou cast us out, send us away into the herd of swine.
  And He said unto them: Go!" (Matt. viii. 31, 32).</p>

  <p>If the concurrent testimony of the three synoptics, then, is really
  sufficient to do away with all rational doubt as to a matter of fact of
  the utmost practical and speculative importance&mdash;belief or disbelief
  in which may affect, and has affected, men's lives and their conduct
  towards other men in the most serious <!-- Page 337 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page337"></a>{337}</span>way&mdash;then I am
  bound to believe that Jesus implicitly affirmed himself to possess a
  "knowledge of the unseen world," which afforded full confirmation of the
  belief in demons and possession current among his contemporaries. If the
  story is true, the mediæval theory of the invisible world may be, and
  probably is, quite correct; and the witchfinders, from Sprenger to
  Hopkins and Mather, are much-maligned men.</p>

  <p>On the other hand, humanity, noting the frightful consequences of this
  belief; common sense, observing the futility of the evidence on which it
  is based, in all cases that have been properly investigated; science,
  more and more seeing its way to enclose all the phenomena of so-called
  "possession" within the domain of pathology, so far as they are not to be
  relegated to that of the police&mdash;all these powerful influences
  concur in warning us, at our peril, against accepting the belief without
  the most careful scrutiny of the authority on which it rests.</p>

  <p>I can discern no escape from this dilemma: either Jesus said what he
  is reported to have said, or he did not. In the former case, it is
  inevitable that his authority on matters connected with the "unseen
  world" should be roughly shaken; in the latter, the blow falls upon the
  authority of the synoptic gospels. If their report on a matter of such
  stupendous and far-reaching practical import as this is untrustworthy,
  how can we be sure of its trustworthiness in other cases? The favourite
  "earth," in which the hard-pressed reconciler takes refuge, that the
  Bible does <!-- Page 338 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page338"></a>{338}</span>not profess to teach science,<a
  name="NtA85" href="#Nt85"><sup>[85]</sup></a> is stopped in this
  instance. For the question of the existence of demons and of possession
  by them, though it lies strictly within the province of science, is also
  of the deepest moral and religious significance. If physical and mental
  disorders are caused by demons, Gregory of Tours and his contemporaries
  rightly considered that relics and exorcists were more useful than
  doctors; the gravest questions arise as to the legal and moral
  responsibilities of persons inspired by demoniacal impulses; and our
  whole conception of the universe and of our relations to it becomes
  totally different from what it would be on the contrary hypothesis.</p>

  <p>The theory of life of an average mediæval Christian was as different
  from that of an average nineteenth-century Englishman as that of a West
  African negro is now, in these respects. The modern world is slowly, but
  surely, shaking off these and other monstrous survivals of savage
  delusions, and, whatever happens, <!-- Page 339 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page339"></a>{339}</span>it will not return to
  that wallowing in the mire. Until the contrary is proved, I venture to
  doubt whether, at this present moment, any Protestant theologian, who has
  a reputation to lose, will say that he believes the Gadarene story.</p>

  <p>The choice then lies between discrediting those who compiled the
  Gospel biographies and disbelieving the Master, whom they, simple souls,
  thought to honour by preserving such traditions of the exercise of his
  authority over Satan's invisible world. This is the dilemma. No deep
  scholarship, nothing but a knowledge of the revised version (on which it
  is to be supposed all that mere scholarship can do has been done), with
  the application thereto of the commonest canons of common sense, is
  needful to enable us to make a choice between its alternatives. It is
  hardly doubtful that the story, as told in the first Gospel, is merely a
  version of that told in the second and third. Nevertheless, the
  discrepancies are serious and irreconcilable; and, on this ground alone,
  a suspension of judgment, at the least, is called for. But there is a
  great deal more to be said. From the dawn of scientific biblical
  criticism until the present day, the evidence against the long-cherished
  notion that the three synoptic Gospels are the works of three independent
  authors, each prompted by Divine inspiration, has steadily accumulated,
  until, at the present time, there is no visible escape from the
  conclusion that each of the three is a compilation consisting of a
  groundwork common to all three&mdash;the threefold tradition; and of a
  superstructure, consisting, firstly, <!-- Page 340 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page340"></a>{340}</span>of matter common to it
  with one of the others, and, secondly, of matter special to each. The use
  of the terms "groundwork" and "superstructure" by no means implies that
  the latter must be of later date than the former. On the contrary, some
  parts of it may be and probably are, older than some parts of the
  groundwork.<a name="NtA86" href="#Nt86"><sup>[86]</sup></a></p>

  <p>The story of the Gadarene swine belongs to the groundwork; at least,
  the essential part of it, in which the belief in demoniac possession is
  expressed, does; and therefore the compilers of the first, second, and
  third Gospels, whoever they were, certainly accepted that belief (which,
  indeed, was universal among both Jews and pagans at that time), and
  attributed it to Jesus.</p>

  <p>What, then, do we know about the originator, or originators, of this
  groundwork&mdash;of that threefold tradition which all three witnesses
  (in Paley's phrase) agree upon&mdash;that we should allow their mere
  statements to outweigh the counter arguments of humanity, of common
  sense, of exact science, and to imperil the respect which all would be
  glad to be able to render to their Master?</p>

  <p>Absolutely nothing.<a name="NtA87" href="#Nt87"><sup>[87]</sup></a>
  There is no proof, nothing <!-- Page 341 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page341"></a>{341}</span>more than a fair presumption, that any one
  of the Gospels existed, in the state in which we find it in the
  authorised version of the Bible, before the second century, or, in other
  words, sixty or seventy years after the events recorded. And, between
  that time and the date of the oldest extant manuscripts of the Gospels,
  there is no telling what additions and alterations and interpolations may
  have been made. It may be said that this is all mere speculation, but it
  is a good deal more. As competent scholars and honest men, our revisers
  have felt compelled to point out that such things have happened even
  since the date of the oldest known manuscripts. The oldest two copies of
  the second Gospel end with the 8th verse of the 16th chapter; the
  remaining twelve verses are spurious, and it is noteworthy that the maker
  of the addition has not hesitated to introduce a speech in which Jesus
  promises his disciples that "in My name shall they cast out devils."</p>

  <p>The other passage "rejected to the margin" is still more instructive.
  It is that touching apologue, with its profound ethical sense, of the
  woman taken in adultery&mdash;which, if internal evidence were an
  infallible guide, might well be affirmed to be a typical example of the
  teachings of Jesus. Yet, say the revisers, pitilessly, "Most of the
  ancient authorities omit John vii. 53-viii. 11." Now let any reasonable
  man ask himself this question. If, after an approximate settlement of the
  canon of the New Testament, and even later than the fourth and fifth
  centuries, literary fabricators had the skill and the audacity to <!--
  Page 342 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page342"></a>{342}</span>make
  such additions and interpolations as these, what may they have done when
  no one had thought of a canon; when oral tradition, still unfixed, was
  regarded as more valuable than such written records as may have existed
  in the latter portion of the first century? Or, to take the other
  alternative, if those who gradually settled the canon did not know of the
  existence of the oldest codices which have come down to us; or if,
  knowing them, they rejected their authority, what is to be thought of
  their competency as critics of the text?</p>

  <p>People who object to free criticism of the Christian Scriptures forget
  that they are what they are in virtue of very free criticism; unless the
  advocates of inspiration are prepared to affirm that the majority of
  influential ecclesiastics during several centuries were safeguarded
  against error. For, even granting that some books of the period were
  inspired, they were certainly few amongst many; and those who selected
  the canonical books, unless they themselves were also inspired, must be
  regarded in the light of mere critics, and, from the evidence they have
  left of their intellectual habits, very uncritical critics. When one
  thinks that such delicate questions as those involved fell into the hands
  of men like Papias (who believed in the famous millenarian grape story);
  of Irenæus with his "reasons" for the existence of only four Gospels; and
  of such calm and dispassionate judges as Tertullian, with his "<i>Credo
  quia impossibile</i>": the marvel is that the selection which constitutes
  our New Testament is as free as it is from obviously objectionable <!--
  Page 343 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page343"></a>{343}</span>matter. The apocryphal Gospels certainly
  deserve to be apocryphal; but one may suspect that a little more critical
  discrimination would have enlarged the Apocrypha not inconsiderably.</p>

  <p>At this point a very obvious objection arises and deserves full and
  candid consideration. It may be said that critical scepticism carried to
  the length suggested is historical pyrrhonism; that if we are to
  altogether discredit an ancient or a modern historian, because he has
  assumed fabulous matter to be true, it will be as well to give up paying
  any attention to history. It may be said, and with great justice, that
  Eginhard's <i>Life of Charlemagne</i> is none the less trustworthy
  because of the astounding revelation of credulity, of lack of judgment,
  and even of respect for the eighth commandment, which he has
  unconsciously made in the <i>History of the Translation of the Blessed
  Martyrs Marcellinus and Paul</i>. Or, to go no further back than the last
  number of this Review, surely that excellent lady, Miss Strickland, is
  not to be refused all credence because of the myth about the second
  James's remains, which she seems to have unconsciously invented.</p>

  <p>Of course this is perfectly true. I am afraid there is no man alive
  whose witness could be accepted, if the condition precedent were proof
  that he had never invented and promulgated a myth. In the minds of all of
  us there are little places here and there, like the indistinguishable
  spots on a rock which give foothold to moss or stonecrop; on which, if
  the germ of a myth fall, it is certain to grow, without in the least <!--
  Page 344 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page344"></a>{344}</span>degree affecting our accuracy or
  truthfulness elsewhere. Sir Walter Scott knew that he could not repeat a
  story without, as he said, "giving it a new hat and stick." Most of us
  differ from Sir Walter only in not knowing about this tendency of the
  mythop&oelig;ic faculty to break out unnoticed. But it is also perfectly
  true that the mythop&oelig;ic faculty is not equally active in all minds,
  nor in all regions and under all conditions of the same mind. David Hume
  was certainly not so liable to temptation as the Venerable Bede, or even
  as some recent historians who could be mentioned; and the most
  imaginative of debtors, if he owes five pounds, never makes an obligation
  to pay a hundred out of it. The rule of common sense is <i>primâ
  facie</i> to trust a witness in all matters in which neither his
  self-interest, his passions, his prejudices, nor that love of the
  marvellous, which is inherent to a greater or less degree in all mankind,
  are strongly concerned; and, when they are involved, to require
  corroborative evidence in exact proportion to the contravention of
  probability by the thing testified.</p>

  <p>Now, in the Gadarene affair, I do not think I am unreasonably
  sceptical if I say that the existence of demons who can be transferred
  from a man to a pig, does thus contravene probability. Let me be
  perfectly candid. I admit I have no <i>à priori</i> objection to offer.
  There are physical things, such as <i>tæniæ</i> and <i>trichinæ</i>,
  which can be transferred from men to pigs, and <i>vice versâ</i>, and
  which do undoubtedly produce most diabolical and deadly effects on both.
  For <!-- Page 345 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page345"></a>{345}</span>anything I can absolutely prove to the
  contrary, there may be spiritual things capable of the same
  transmigration, with like effects. Moreover I am bound to add that
  perfectly truthful persons, for whom I have the greatest respect, believe
  in stories about spirits of the present day, quite as improbable as that
  we are considering.</p>

  <p>So I declare, as plainly as I can, that I am unable to show cause why
  these transferable devils should not exist; nor can I deny that, not
  merely the whole Roman Church, but many Wacean "infidels" of no mean
  repute, do honestly and firmly believe that the activity of such like
  demonic beings is in full swing in this year of grace 1889.</p>

  <p>Nevertheless, as good Bishop Butler says, "probability is the guide of
  life," and it seems to me that this is just one of the cases in which the
  canon of credibility and testimony, which I have ventured to lay down,
  has full force. So that, with the most entire respect for many (by no
  means for all) of our witnesses for the truth of demonology, ancient and
  modern, I conceive their evidence on this particular matter to be
  ridiculously insufficient to warrant their conclusion.<a name="NtA88"
  href="#Nt88"><sup>[88]</sup></a></p>

<p><!-- Page 346 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page346"></a>{346}</span></p>

  <p>After what has been said, I do not think that any sensible man, unless
  he happen to be angry, will accuse me of "contradicting the Lord and his
  Apostles" if I reiterate my total disbelief in the whole Gadarene story.
  But, if that story is discredited, all the other stories of demoniac
  possession fall under suspicion. And if the belief in demons and demoniac
  possession, which forms the sombre background of the whole picture of
  primitive Christianity presented to us in the New Testament, is shaken,
  what is to be said, in any case, of the uncorroborated testimony of the
  Gospels with respect to "the unseen world"?</p>

  <p>I am not aware that I have been influenced by any more bias in regard
  to the Gadarene story than I have been in dealing with other cases of
  like kind the investigation of which has interested me. I was brought up
  in the strictest school of evangelical orthodoxy; and when I was old
  enough to think for myself, I started upon my journey of inquiry with
  little doubt about the general truth of what I had been taught; and with
  that feeling of the unpleasantness of being called an "infidel" which, we
  are told, is so right and proper. Near my journey's end, I find myself in
  a condition of something more than mere doubt about these matters.</p>

<p><!-- Page 347 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page347"></a>{347}</span></p>

  <p>In the course of other inquiries, I have had to do with fossil remains
  which looked quite plain at a distance, and became more and more
  indistinct as I tried to define their outline by close inspection. There
  was something there&mdash;something which, if I could win assurance about
  it, might mark a new epoch in the history of the earth; but, study as
  long as I might, certainty eluded my grasp. So has it been with me in my
  efforts to define the grand figure of Jesus as it lies in the primary
  strata of Christian literature. Is he the kindly, peaceful Christ
  depicted in the Catacombs? Or is he the stern Judge who frowns above the
  altar of SS. Cosmas and Damianus? Or can he be rightly represented by the
  bleeding ascetic, broken down by physical pain, of too many mediæval
  pictures? Are we to accept the Jesus of the second, or the Jesus of the
  fourth Gospel, as the true Jesus? What did he really say and do; and how
  much that is attributed to him, in speech and action, is the embroidery
  of the various parties into which his followers tended to split
  themselves within twenty years of his death, when even the threefold
  tradition was only nascent?</p>

  <p>If any one will answer these questions for me with something more to
  the point than feeble talk about the "cowardice of agnosticism," I shall
  be deeply his debtor. Unless and until they are satisfactorily answered,
  I say of agnosticism in this matter, "<i>J'y suis, et j'y reste</i>."</p>

  <p>But, as we have seen, it is asserted that I have no business to call
  myself an agnostic; that if I am <!-- Page 348 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page348"></a>{348}</span>not a Christian I am an
  infidel; and that I ought to call myself by that name of "unpleasant
  significance." Well, I do not care much what I am called by other people,
  and if I had at my side all those who, since the Christian era, have been
  called infidels by other folks, I could not desire better company. If
  these are my ancestors, I prefer, with the old Frank, to be with them
  wherever they are. But there are several points in Dr. Wace's contention
  which must be elucidated before I can even think of undertaking to carry
  out his wishes. I must, for instance, know what a Christian is. Now what
  is a Christian? By whose authority is the signification of that term
  defined? Is there any doubt that the immediate followers of Jesus, the
  "sect of the Nazarenes," were strictly orthodox Jews, differing from
  other Jews not more than the Sadducees, the Pharisees, and the Essenes
  differed from one another; in fact, only in the belief that the Messiah,
  for whom the rest of their nation waited, had come? Was not their chief,
  "James, the brother of the Lord," reverenced alike by Sadducee, Pharisee,
  and Nazarene? At the famous conference which, according to the Acts, took
  place at Jerusalem, does not James declare that "myriads" of Jews, who by
  that time had become Nazarenes, were "all zealous for the Law"? Was not
  the name of "Christian" first used to denote the converts to the doctrine
  promulgated by Paul and Barnabas at Antioch? Does the subsequent history
  of Christianity leave any doubt that, from this time forth, the "little
  rift within <!-- Page 349 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page349"></a>{349}</span>the lute" caused by the new teaching,
  developed, if not inaugurated, at Antioch, grew wider and wider, until
  the two types of doctrine irreconcilably diverged? Did not the primitive
  Nazarenism, or Ebionism, develop into the Nazarenism, and Ebionism, and
  Elkasaitism of later ages, and finally die out in obscurity and
  condemnation as damnable heresy; while the younger doctrine throve and
  pushed out its shoots into that endless variety of sects, of which the
  three strongest survivors are the Roman and Greek Churches and modern
  Protestantism?</p>

  <p>Singular state of things! If I were to profess the doctrine which was
  held by "James, the brother of the Lord," and by every one of the
  "myriads" of his followers and co-religionists in Jerusalem up to twenty
  or thirty years after the Crucifixion (and one knows not how much later
  at Pella), I should be condemned with unanimity as an ebionising heretic
  by the Roman, Greek, and Protestant Churches! And, probably, this hearty
  and unanimous condemnation of the creed held by those who were in the
  closest personal relation with their Lord is almost the only point upon
  which they would be cordially of one mind. On the other hand, though I
  hardly dare imagine such a thing, I very much fear that the "pillars" of
  the primitive Hierosolymitan Church would have considered Dr. Wace an
  infidel. No one can read the famous second chapter of Galatians and the
  book of Revelations without seeing how narrow was even Paul's escape from
  a similar <!-- Page 350 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page350"></a>{350}</span>fate. And, if ecclesiastical history is to
  be trusted, the thirty-nine articles, be they right or wrong, diverge
  from the primitive doctrine of the Nazarenes vastly more than even
  Pauline Christianity did.</p>

  <p>But, further than this, I have great difficulty in assuring myself
  that even James, "the brother of the Lord," and his "myriads" of
  Nazarenes, properly represented the doctrines of their Master. For it is
  constantly asserted by our modern "pillars" that one of the chief
  features of the work of Jesus was the instauration of Religion by the
  abolition of what our sticklers for articles and liturgies, with
  unconscious humour, call the narrow restrictions of the Law. Yet, if
  James knew this, how could the bitter controversy with Paul have arisen;
  and why did one or the other side not quote any of the various sayings of
  Jesus, recorded in the Gospels, which directly bear on the
  question&mdash;sometimes, apparently, in opposite directions?</p>

  <p>So if I am asked to call myself an "infidel," I reply: To what
  doctrine do you ask me to be faithful? Is it that contained in the Nicene
  and the Athanasian Creeds? My firm belief is that the Nazarenes, say of
  the year 40, headed by James, would have stopped their ears and thought
  worthy of stoning the audacious man who propounded it to them. Is it
  contained in the so-called Apostles' Creed? I am pretty sure that even
  that would have created a recalcitrant commotion at Pella in the year 70,
  among the Nazarenes of Jerusalem, who had fled from the soldiers of
  Titus. And yet, if the <!-- Page 351 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page351"></a>{351}</span>unadulterated tradition of the teachings
  of "the Nazarene" were to be found anywhere, it surely should have been
  amidst those not very aged disciples who may have heard them as they were
  delivered.</p>

  <p>Therefore, however sorry I may be to be unable to demonstrate that, if
  necessary, I should not be afraid to call myself an "infidel," I cannot
  do it. "Infidel" is a term of reproach, which Christians and Mahommedans,
  in their modesty, agree to apply to those who differ from them. If he had
  only thought of it, Dr. Wace might have used the term "miscreant," which,
  with the same etymological signification, has the advantage of being
  still more "unpleasant" to the persons to whom it is applied. But why
  should a man be expected to call himself a "miscreant" or an "infidel"?
  That St. Patrick "had two birthdays because he was a twin" is a
  reasonable and intelligible utterance beside that of the man who should
  declare himself to be an infidel on the ground of denying his own belief.
  It may be logically, if not ethically, defensible that a Christian should
  call a Mahommedan an infidel and <i>vice versâ</i>; but, on Dr. Wace's
  principles, both ought to call themselves infidels, because each applies
  the term to the other.</p>

  <p>Now I am afraid that all the Mahommedan world would agree in
  reciprocating that appellation to Dr. Wace himself. I once visited the
  Hazar Mosque, the great University of Mahommedanism, in Cairo, in
  ignorance of the fact that I was unprovided with <!-- Page 352 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page352"></a>{352}</span>proper authority. A
  swarm of angry undergraduates, as I suppose I ought to call them, came
  buzzing about me and my guide; and if I had known Arabic, I suspect that
  "dog of an infidel" would have been by no means the most "unpleasant" of
  the epithets showered upon me, before I could explain and apologise for
  the mistake. If I had had the pleasure of Dr. Wace's company on that
  occasion, the undiscriminative followers of the Prophet would, I am
  afraid, have made no difference between us; not even if they had known
  that he was the head of an orthodox Christian seminary. And I have not
  the smallest doubt that even one of the learned mollahs, if his grave
  courtesy would have permitted him to say anything offensive to men of
  another mode of belief, would have told us that he wondered we did not
  find it "very unpleasant" to disbelieve in the Prophet of Islam.</p>

  <p>From what precedes, I think it becomes sufficiently clear that Dr.
  Wace's account of the origin of the name of "Agnostic" is quite wrong.
  Indeed, I am bound to add that very slight effort to discover the truth
  would have convinced him that, as a matter of fact, the term arose
  otherwise. I am loath to go over an old story once more; but more than
  one object which I have in view will be served by telling it a little
  more fully than it has yet been told.</p>

  <p>Looking back nearly fifty years, I see myself as a boy, whose
  education had been interrupted, and who, intellectually, was left, for
  some years, altogether to his own devices. At that time, I was a
  voracious <!-- Page 353 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page353"></a>{353}</span>and omnivorous reader; a dreamer and
  speculator of the first water, well endowed with that splendid courage in
  attacking any and every subject, which is the blessed compensation of
  youth and inexperience. Among the books and essays, on all sorts of
  topics from metaphysics to heraldry, which I read at this time, two left
  indelible impressions on my mind. One was Guizot's <i>History of
  Civilisation</i>, the other was Sir William Hamilton's essay <i>On the
  Philosophy of the Unconditioned</i>, which I came upon, by chance, in an
  odd volume of the <i>Edinburgh Review</i>. The latter was certainly
  strange reading for a boy, and I could not possibly have understood a
  great deal of it;<a name="NtA89" href="#Nt89"><sup>[89]</sup></a>
  nevertheless, I devoured it with avidity, and it stamped upon my mind the
  strong conviction that, on even the most solemn and important of
  questions, men are apt to take cunning phrases for answers; and that the
  limitation of our faculties, in a great number of cases, renders real
  answers to such questions, not merely actually impossible, but
  theoretically inconceivable.</p>

  <p>Philosophy and history having laid hold of me in this eccentric
  fashion, have never loosened their grip. I have no pretension to be an
  expert in either subject; but the turn for philosophical and historical
  reading, which rendered Hamilton and Guizot attractive to me, has not
  only filled many <!-- Page 354 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page354"></a>{354}</span>lawful leisure hours, and still more
  sleepless ones, with the repose of changed mental occupation, but has not
  unfrequently disputed my proper work-time with my liege lady, Natural
  Science. In this way, I have found it possible to cover a good deal of
  ground in the territory of philosophy; and all the more easily that I
  have never cared much about A's or B's opinions, but have rather sought
  to know what answer he had to give to the questions I had to put to
  him&mdash;that of the limitation of possible knowledge being the chief.
  The ordinary examiner, with his "State the views of So-and-so," would
  have floored me at any time. If he had said what do <i>you</i> think
  about any given problem, I might have got on fairly well.</p>

  <p>The reader who has had the patience to follow the enforced, but
  unwilling, egotism of this veritable history (especially if his studies
  have led him in the same direction), will now see why my mind steadily
  gravitated towards the conclusions of Hume and Kant, so well stated by
  the latter in a sentence, which I have quoted elsewhere.</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"The greatest and perhaps the sole use of all philosophy of pure
  reason is, after all, merely negative, since it serves not as an organon
  for the enlargement [of knowledge], but as a discipline for its
  delimitation; and, instead of discovering truth, has only the modest
  merit of preventing error."<a name="NtA90"
  href="#Nt90"><sup>[90]</sup></a></p>

</blockquote>

  <p>When I reached intellectual maturity and began to ask myself whether I
  was an atheist, a theist, or <!-- Page 355 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page355"></a>{355}</span>a pantheist; a materialist or an idealist;
  a Christian or a freethinker; I found that the more I learned and
  reflected, the less ready was the answer; until, at last, I came to the
  conclusion that I had neither art nor part with any of these
  denominations, except the last. The one thing in which most of these good
  people were agreed was the one thing in which I differed from them. They
  were quite sure they had attained a certain "gnosis,"&mdash;had, more or
  less successfully, solved the problem of existence; while I was quite
  sure I had not, and had a pretty strong conviction that the problem was
  insoluble. And, with Hume and Kant on my side, I could not think myself
  presumptuous in holding fast by that opinion. Like Dante,</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p>Nel mezzo del cammin di nostra vita</p>
      <p class="i2">Mi ritrovai per una selva oscura,</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>but, unlike Dante, I cannot add,</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p>Che la diritta via era smarrita.</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>On the contrary, I had, and have, the firmest conviction that I never
  left the "verace via"&mdash;the straight road; and that this road led
  nowhere else but into the dark depths of a wild and tangled forest. And
  though I have found leopards and lions in the path; though I have made
  abundant acquaintance with the hungry wolf, that "with privy paw devours
  apace and nothing said," as another great poet says of the ravening
  beast; and though no friendly spectre has even yet offered his guidance,
  I was, and am, minded to go straight on, until I either come out on the
  <!-- Page 356 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page356"></a>{356}</span>other side of the wood, or find there is
  no other side to it, at least, none attainable by me.</p>

  <p>This was my situation when I had the good fortune to find a place
  among the members of that remarkable confraternity of antagonists, long
  since deceased, but of green and pious memory, the Metaphysical Society.
  Every variety of philosophical and theological opinion was represented
  there, and expressed itself with entire openness; most of my colleagues
  were <i>-ists</i> of one sort or another; and, however kind and friendly
  they might be, I, the man without a rag of a label to cover himself with,
  could not fail to have some of the uneasy feelings which must have beset
  the historical fox when, after leaving the trap in which his tail
  remained, he presented himself to his normally elongated companions. So I
  took thought, and invented what I conceived to be the appropriate title
  of "agnostic." It came into my head as suggestively antithetic to the
  "gnostic" of Church history, who professed to know so much about the very
  things of which I was ignorant; and I took the earliest opportunity of
  parading it at our Society, to show that I, too, had a tail, like the
  other foxes. To my great satisfaction, the term took; and when the
  <i>Spectator</i> had stood godfather to it, any suspicion in the minds of
  respectable people, that a knowledge of its parentage might have
  awakened, was, of course, completely lulled.</p>

  <p>That is the history of the origin of the terms "agnostic" and
  "agnosticism"; and it will be observed that it does not quite agree with
  the <!-- Page 357 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page357"></a>{357}</span>confident assertion of the reverend
  Principal of King's College, that "the adoption of the term agnostic is
  only an attempt to shift the issue, and that it involves a mere evasion"
  in relation to the Church and Christianity.<a name="NtA91"
  href="#Nt91"><sup>[91]</sup></a></p>

  <p>&nbsp;</p>

  <p>The last objection (I rejoice, as much as my readers must do, that it
  is the last) which I have to take to Dr. Wace's deliverance before the
  Church Congress arises, I am sorry to say, on a question of morality.</p>

  <p>"It is, and it ought to be," authoritatively declares this official
  representative of Christian ethics, "an unpleasant thing for a man to
  have to say plainly that he does not believe in Jesus Christ" (<i>l.
  c.</i> p. 254).</p>

  <p>Whether it is so depends, I imagine, a good deal on whether the man
  was brought up in a Christian household or not. I do not see why it
  should be "unpleasant" for a Mahommedan or Buddhist to say so. But that
  "it ought to be" unpleasant for any man to say anything which he
  sincerely, and after due deliberation, believes, is, to my mind, a
  proposition of the most profoundly immoral character. I verily believe
  that the great good which has been effected in the world by Christianity
  has been largely counteracted by the pestilent doctrine on which all the
  Churches have insisted, that honest disbelief in their more or less
  astonishing creeds is a moral offence, indeed a sin of the deepest dye,
  deserving <!-- Page 358 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page358"></a>{358}</span>and involving the same future retribution
  as murder and robbery. If we could only see, in one view, the torrents of
  hypocrisy and cruelty, the lies, the slaughter, the violations of every
  obligation of humanity, which have flowed from this source along the
  course of the history of Christian nations, our worst imaginations of
  Hell would pale beside the vision.</p>

  <p>A thousand times, no! It ought <i>not</i> to be unpleasant to say that
  which one honestly believes or disbelieves. That it so constantly is
  painful to do so, is quite enough obstacle to the progress of mankind in
  that most valuable of all qualities, honesty of word or of deed, without
  erecting a sad concomitant of human weakness into something to be admired
  and cherished. The bravest of soldiers often, and very naturally, "feel
  it unpleasant" to go into action; but a court-martial which did its duty
  would make short work of the officer who promulgated the doctrine that
  his men <i>ought</i> to feel their duty unpleasant.</p>

  <p>I am very well aware, as I suppose most thoughtful people are in these
  times, that the process of breaking away from old beliefs is extremely
  unpleasant; and I am much disposed to think that the encouragement, the
  consolation, and the peace afforded to earnest believers in even the
  worst forms of Christianity are of great practical advantage to them.
  What deductions must be made from this gain on the score of the harm done
  to the citizen by the ascetic otherworldliness of logical Christianity;
  to the ruler, by <!-- Page 359 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page359"></a>{359}</span>the hatred, malice, and all
  uncharitableness of sectarian bigotry; to the legislator, by the spirit
  of exclusiveness and domination of those that count themselves pillars of
  orthodoxy; to the philosopher, by the restraints on the freedom of
  learning and teaching which every Church exercises, when it is strong
  enough; to the conscientious soul, by the introspective hunting after
  sins of the mint and cummin type, the fear of theological error, and the
  overpowering terror of possible damnation, which have accompanied the
  Churches like their shadow, I need not now consider; but they are
  assuredly not small. If agnostics lose heavily on the one side, they gain
  a good deal on the other. People who talk about the comforts of belief
  appear to forget its discomforts; they ignore the fact that the
  Christianity of the Churches is something more than faith in the ideal
  personality of Jesus, which they create for themselves, <i>plus</i> so
  much as can be carried into practice, without disorganising civil
  society, of the maxims of the Sermon on the Mount. Trip in morals or in
  doctrine (especially in doctrine), without due repentance or
  retractation, or fail to get properly baptized before you die, and a
  <i>plébiscite</i> of the Christians of Europe, if they were true to their
  creeds, would affirm your everlasting damnation by an immense
  majority.</p>

  <p>Preachers, orthodox and heterodox, din into our ears that the world
  cannot get on without faith of some sort. There is a sense in which that
  is as eminently as obviously true; there is another, in <!-- Page 360
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page360"></a>{360}</span>which, in my
  judgment, it is as eminently as obviously false, and it seems to me that
  the hortatory, or pulpit, mind is apt to oscillate between the false and
  the true meanings, without being aware of the fact.</p>

  <p>It is quite true that the ground of every one of our actions, and the
  validity of all our reasonings, rest upon the great act of faith, which
  leads us to take the experience of the past as a safe guide in our
  dealings with the present and the future. From the nature of
  ratiocination it is obvious that the axioms on which it is based cannot
  be demonstrated by ratiocination. It is also a trite observation that, in
  the business of life, we constantly take the most serious action upon
  evidence of an utterly insufficient character. But it is surely plain
  that faith is not necessarily entitled to dispense with ratiocination
  because ratiocination cannot dispense with faith as a starting-point; and
  that because we are often obliged, by the pressure of events, to act on
  very bad evidence, it does not follow that it is proper to act on such
  evidence when the pressure is absent.</p>

  <p>The writer of the epistle to the Hebrews tells us that "faith is the
  assurance of things hoped for, the proving of things not seen." In the
  authorised version "substance" stands for "assurance," and "evidence" for
  "proving." The question of the exact meaning of the two words, <span
  title="hupostasis" class="grk"
  >&#x1F51;&pi;&#x1F79;&sigma;&tau;&alpha;&sigma;&iota;&sigmaf;</span> and
  <span title="elenchos" class="grk"
  >&#x1F14;&lambda;&epsilon;&gamma;&chi;&omicron;&sigmaf;</span>, affords a
  fine field of discussion for the scholar and the metaphysician. But I
  fancy we shall be not far from the mark if we take the writer to have had
  in his mind the profound psychological <!-- Page 361 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page361"></a>{361}</span>truth that men
  constantly feel certain about things for which they strongly hope, but
  have no evidence, in the legal or logical sense of the word; and he calls
  this feeling "faith." I may have the most absolute faith that a friend
  has not committed the crime of which he is accused. In the early days of
  English history, if my friend could have obtained a few more compurgators
  of a like robust faith, he would have been acquitted. At the present day,
  if I tendered myself as a witness on that score, the judge would tell me
  to stand down, and the youngest barrister would smile at my simplicity.
  Miserable indeed is the man who has not such faith in some of his
  fellow-men&mdash;only less miserable than the man who allows himself to
  forget that such faith is not, strictly speaking, evidence; and when his
  faith is disappointed, as will happen now and again, turns Timon and
  blames the universe for his own blunders. And so, if a man can find a
  friend, the hypostasis of all his hopes, the mirror of his ethical ideal,
  in the Jesus of any, or all, of the Gospels, let him live by faith in
  that ideal. Who shall or can forbid him? But let him not delude himself
  with the notion that his faith is evidence of the objective reality of
  that in which he trusts. Such evidence is to be obtained only by the use
  of the methods of science, as applied to history and to literature, and
  it amounts at present to very little.</p>

  <p>&nbsp;</p>

  <p>It appears that Mr. Gladstone some time ago asked Mr. Laing if he
  could draw up a short summary <!-- Page 362 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page362"></a>{362}</span>of the negative creed; a body of negative
  propositions, which have so far been adopted on the negative side as to
  be what the Apostles' and other accepted creeds are on the positive; and
  Mr. Laing at once kindly obliged Mr. Gladstone with the desired
  articles&mdash;eight of them.</p>

  <p>If any one had preferred this request to me I should have replied
  that, if he referred to agnostics, they have no creed; and, by the nature
  of the case, cannot have any. Agnosticism, in fact, is not a creed, but a
  method, the essence of which lies in the rigorous application of a single
  principle. That principle is of great antiquity; it is as old as
  Socrates; as old as the writer who said, "Try all things, hold fast by
  that which is good;" it is the foundation of the Reformation, which
  simply illustrated the axiom that every man should be able to give a
  reason for the faith that is in him; it is the great principle of
  Descartes; it is the fundamental axiom of modern science. Positively the
  principle may be expressed: In matters of the intellect follow your
  reason as far as it will take you without regard to any other
  consideration. And negatively: In matters of the intellect do not pretend
  that conclusions are certain which are not demonstrated or demonstrable.
  That I take to be the agnostic faith, which if a man keep whole and
  undefiled, he shall not be ashamed to look the universe in the face,
  whatever the future may have in store for him.</p>

  <p>The results of the working out of the agnostic principle will vary
  according to individual knowledge <!-- Page 363 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page363"></a>{363}</span>and capacity, and
  according to the general condition of science. That which is unproven
  to-day may be proven by the help of new discoveries to-morrow. The only
  negative fixed points will be those negations which flow from the
  demonstrable limitation of our faculties. And the only obligation
  accepted is to have the mind always open to conviction. Agnostics who
  never fail in carrying out their principles are, I am afraid, as rare as
  other people of whom the same consistency can be truthfully predicated.
  But, if you were to meet with such a ph&oelig;nix and to tell him that
  you had discovered that two and two make five, he would patiently ask you
  to state your reasons for that conviction, and express his readiness to
  agree with you if he found them satisfactory. The apostolic injunction to
  "suffer fools gladly" should be the rule of life of a true agnostic. I am
  deeply conscious how far I myself fall short of this ideal, but it is my
  personal conception of what agnostics ought to be.</p>

  <p>However, as I began by stating, I speak only for myself; and I do not
  dream of anathematizing and excommunicating Mr. Laing. But, when I
  consider his creed and compare it with the Athanasian, I think I have on
  the whole a clearer conception of the meaning of the latter. "Polarity,"
  in Article VIII., for example, is a word about which I heard a good deal
  in my youth, when "Naturphilosophie" was in fashion, and greatly did I
  suffer from it. For many years past, whenever I have met with "polarity"
  anywhere but in a discussion of some purely physical topic, such as
  magnetism, I have shut the book. Mr. <!-- Page 364 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page364"></a>{364}</span>Laing must excuse me if
  the force of habit was too much for me when I read his eighth
  article.</p>

  <p>&nbsp;</p>

  <p>And now, what is to be said to Mr. Harrison's remarkable deliverance
  "On the future of agnosticism"?<a name="NtA92"
  href="#Nt92"><sup>[92]</sup></a> I would that it were not my business to
  say anything, for I am afraid that I can say nothing which shall manifest
  my great personal respect for this able writer, and for the zeal and
  energy with which he ever and anon galvanises the weakly frame of
  Positivism until it looks more than ever like John Bunyan's Pope and
  Pagan rolled into one. There is a story often repeated, and I am afraid
  none the less mythical on that account, of a valiant and loud-voiced
  corporal in command of two full privates who, falling in with a regiment
  of the enemy in the dark, orders it to surrender under pain of instant
  annihilation by his force; and the enemy surrenders accordingly. I am
  always reminded of this tale when I read the positivist commands to the
  forces of Christianity and of Science; only the enemy show no more signs
  of intending to obey now than they have done any time these forty
  years.</p>

  <p>The allocution under consideration has the papal flavour which is wont
  to hang about the utterances of the pontiffs of the Church of Comte. Mr.
  Harrison speaks with authority and not as one of the common scribes of
  the period. He knows not only what agnosticism is and how it has come
  about, but <span class="correction" title="Original reads 'what what' across line break."
  >what</span> will become of it. The agnostic is to content <!-- Page 365
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page365"></a>{365}</span>himself with
  being the precursor of the positivist. In his place, as a sort of navvy
  levelling the ground and cleansing it of such poor stuff as Christianity,
  he is a useful creature who deserves patting on the back, on condition
  that he does not venture beyond his last. But let not these scientific
  Sanballats presume that they are good enough to take part in the building
  of the Temple&mdash;they are mere Samaritans, doomed to die out in
  proportion as the Religion of Humanity is accepted by mankind. Well, if
  that is their fate, they have time to be cheerful. But let us hear Mr.
  Harrison's pronouncement of their doom.</p>

  <p>"Agnosticism is a stage in the evolution of religion, an entirely
  negative stage, the point reached by physicists, a purely mental
  conclusion, with no relation to things social at all" (p. 154). I am
  quite dazed by this declaration. Are there, then, any "conclusions" that
  are not "purely mental"? Is there "no relation to things social" in
  "mental conclusions" which affect men's whole conception of life? Was
  that prince of agnostics, David Hume, particularly imbued with physical
  science? Supposing physical science to be non-existent, would not the
  agnostic principle, applied by the philologist and the historian, lead to
  exactly the same results? Is the modern more or less complete suspension
  of judgment as to the facts of the history of regal Rome, or the real
  origin of the Homeric poems, anything but agnosticism in history and in
  literature? And if so, how can agnosticism be the "mere negation of the
  physicist"? <!-- Page 366 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page366"></a>{366}</span></p>

  <p>"Agnosticism is a stage in the evolution of religion." No two people
  agree as to what is meant by the term "religion"; but if it means, as I
  think it ought to mean, simply the reverence and love for the ethical
  ideal, and the desire to realise that ideal in life, which every man
  ought to feel&mdash;then I say agnosticism has no more to do with it than
  it has to do with music or painting. If, on the other hand, Mr. Harrison,
  like most people, means by "religion" theology, then in my judgment
  agnosticism can be said to be a stage in its evolution, only as death may
  be said to be the final stage in the evolution of life.</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>When agnostic logic is simply one of the canons of thought,
  agnosticism, as a distinctive faith, will have spontaneously disappeared
  (p. 155).</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>I can but marvel that such sentences as this, and those already
  quoted, should have proceeded from Mr. Harrison's pen. Does he really
  mean to suggest that agnostics have a logic peculiar to themselves? Will
  he kindly help me out of my bewilderment when I try to think of "logic"
  being anything else than the canon (which, I believe, means rule) of
  thought? As to agnosticism being a distinctive faith, I have already
  shown that it cannot possibly be anything of the kind, unless perfect
  faith in logic is distinctive of agnostics; which, after all, it may
  be.</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>Agnosticism as a religious philosophy <i>per se</i> rests on an almost
  total ignoring of history and social evolution (p. 152).</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>But neither <i>per se</i> nor <i>per aliud</i> has agnosticism (if I
  know anything about it) the least pretension to be a religious
  philosophy; so far from resting on <!-- Page 367 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page367"></a>{367}</span>ignorance of history,
  and that social evolution of which history is the account, it is and has
  been the inevitable result of the strict adherence to scientific methods
  by historical investigators. Our forefathers were quite confident about
  the existence of Romulus and Remus, of King Arthur, and of Hengist and
  Horsa. Most of us have become agnostics in regard to the reality of these
  worthies. It is a matter of notoriety of which Mr. Harrison, who accuses
  us all so freely of ignoring history, should not be ignorant, that the
  critical process which has shattered the foundations of orthodox
  Christian doctrine owes its origin, not to the devotees of physical
  science, but, before all, to Richard Simon, the learned French Oratorian,
  just two hundred years ago. I cannot find evidence that either Simon, or
  any one of the great scholars and critics of the eighteenth and
  nineteenth centuries who have continued Simon's work, had any particular
  acquaintance with physical science. I have already pointed out that Hume
  was independent of it. And certainly one of the most potent influences in
  the same direction, upon history in the present century, that of Grote,
  did not come from the physical side. Physical science, in fact, has had
  nothing directly to do with the criticism of the Gospels; it is wholly
  incompetent to furnish demonstrative evidence that any statement made in
  these histories is untrue. Indeed, modern physiology can find parallels
  in nature for events of apparently the most eminently supernatural kind
  recounted in some of those histories. <!-- Page 368 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page368"></a>{368}</span></p>

  <p>It is a comfort to hear, upon Mr. Harrison's authority, that the laws
  of physical nature show no signs of becoming "less definite, less
  consistent, or less popular as time goes on" (p. 154). How a law of
  nature is to become indefinite, or "inconsistent," passes my poor powers
  of imagination. But with universal suffrage and the coach-dog theory of
  premiership in full view; the theory, I mean, that the whole duty of a
  political chief is to look sharp for the way the social coach is driving,
  and then run in front and bark loud&mdash;as if being the leading
  noise-maker and guiding were the same things&mdash;it is truly
  satisfactory to me to know that the laws of nature are increasing in
  popularity. Looking at recent developments of the policy which is said to
  express the great heart of the people, I have had my doubts of the fact;
  and my love for my fellow-countrymen has led me to reflect with dread on
  what will happen to them if any of the laws of nature ever become so
  unpopular in their eyes as to be voted down by the transcendent authority
  of universal suffrage. If the legion of demons, before they set out on
  their journey in the swine, had had time to hold a meeting and to resolve
  unanimously "That the law of gravitation is oppressive and ought to be
  repealed," I am afraid it would have made no sort of difference to the
  result, when their two thousand unwilling porters were once launched down
  the steep slopes of the fatal shore of Gennesaret.</p>

  <p>I doubt not that Mr. Harrison knows vastly more about history than I
  do; in fact, he tells the public that some of my friends and I have had
  no opportunity of occupying ourselves with that subject. I do not like to
  contradict any statement which Mr. Harrison makes on his own authority;
  only, if I may be true to my agnostic principles, I humbly ask how he has
  obtained assurance on this head. I do not profess to know anything about
  the range of Mr. Harrison's studies; but as he has thought it fitting to
  start the subject, I may venture to point out that, on evidence adduced,
  it might be equally permissible to draw the conclusion that Mr.
  Harrison's absorbing labours as the <i>pontifex maximus</i> of the
  positivist religion have not allowed him to acquire that acquaintance
  with the methods and results of physical science, or with the history of
  philosophy, or of philological and historical criticism, which is
  essential to any one who desires to obtain a right understanding of
  agnosticism. Incompetence in philosophy, and in all branches of science
  except mathematics, is the well-known mental characteristic of the
  founder of positivism. Faithfulness in disciples is an admirable quality
  in itself; the pity is that it not unfrequently leads to the imitation of
  the weaknesses as well as of the strength of the master. It is only such
  overfaithfulness which can account for a "strong mind really saturated
  with the historical sense" (p. 153) exhibiting the extraordinary
  forgetfulness of the <!-- Page 370 --><span class="pagenum"><a

  <p>Whoso calls to mind what I may venture to term the bright side of
  Christianity&mdash;that ideal of manhood, with its strength and its
  patience, its justice and its pity for human frailty, its helpfulness to
  the extremity of self-sacrifice, its ethical purity and nobility, which
  apostles have pictured, in which armies of martyrs have placed their
  unshakable faith, and whence obscure men and women, like Catherine of
  Sienna and John Knox, have derived the courage to rebuke popes and
  kings&mdash;is not likely to underrate the importance of the Christian
  faith as a factor in human history, or to doubt that if that faith should
  prove to be incompatible with our knowledge, or necessary want of
  knowledge, some other hypostasis of men's hopes, genuine enough and
  worthy enough to replace it, will arise. But that the incongruous mixture
  of bad science with eviscerated papistry, out of which Comte manufactured
  the positivist religion, will be the heir of the Christian ages, I have
  too much respect for the humanity of the future to believe. Charles the
  Second told his brother, "They will not kill me, James, to make you
  king." And if critical science is remorselessly destroying the historical
  foundations of the noblest ideal of humanity which mankind have yet <!--
  Page 371 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page371"></a>{371}</span>worshipped, it is little likely to permit
  the pitiful reality to climb into the vacant shrine.</p>

  <p>That a man should determine to devote himself to the service of
  humanity&mdash;including intellectual and moral self-culture under that
  name; that this should be, in the proper sense of the word, his
  religion&mdash;is not only an intelligible, but, I think, a laudable
  resolution. And I am greatly disposed to believe that it is the only
  religion which will prove itself to be unassailably acceptable so long as
  the human race endures. But when the positivist asks me to worship
  "Humanity"&mdash;that is to say, to adore the generalised conception of
  men as they ever have been and probably ever will be&mdash;I must reply
  that I could just as soon bow down and worship the generalised conception
  of a "wilderness of apes." Surely we are not going back to the days of
  Paganism, when individual men were deified, and the hard good sense of a
  dying Vespasian could prompt the bitter jest, "Ut puto Deus fio." No
  divinity doth hedge a modern man, be he even a sovereign ruler. Nor is
  there any one, except a municipal magistrate, who is officially declared
  worshipful. But if there is no spark of worship-worthy divinity in the
  individual twigs of humanity, whence comes that godlike splendour which
  the Moses of Positivism fondly imagines to pervade the whole bush.</p>

  <p>I know no study which is so unutterably saddening as that of the
  evolution of humanity, as it is set forth in the annals of history. Out
  of the darkness of prehistoric ages man emerges with the marks of <!--
  Page 372 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page372"></a>{372}</span>his
  lowly origin strong upon him. He is a brute, only more intelligent than
  the other brutes, a blind prey to impulses, which as often as not lead
  him to destruction; a victim to endless illusions, which make his mental
  existence a terror and a burden, and fill his physical life with barren
  toil and battle. He attains a certain degree of physical comfort, and
  develops a more or less workable theory of life, in such favourable
  situations as the plains of Mesopotamia or of Egypt, and then, for
  thousands and thousands of years, struggles, with varying fortunes,
  attended by infinite wickedness, bloodshed, and misery, to maintain
  himself at this point against the greed and the ambition of his
  fellow-men. He makes a point of killing and otherwise persecuting all
  those who first try to get him to move on; and when he has moved on a
  step, foolishly confers post-mortem deification on his victims. He
  exactly repeats the process with all who want to move a step yet farther.
  And the best men of the best epochs are simply those who make the fewest
  blunders and commit the fewest sins.</p>

  <p>That one should rejoice in the good man, forgive the bad man, and pity
  and help all men to the best of one's ability, is surely indisputable. It
  is the glory of Judaism and of Christianity to have proclaimed this
  truth, through all their aberrations. But the worship of a God who needs
  forgiveness and help, and deserves pity every hour of his existence, is
  no better than that of any other voluntarily selected fetish. The Emperor
  Julian's project was hopeful in <!-- Page 373 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page373"></a>{373}</span>comparison with the prospects of the new
  Anthropolatry.</p>

  <p>&nbsp;</p>

  <p>When the historian of religion in the twentieth century is writing
  about the nineteenth, I foresee he will say something of this kind:</p>

  <p>The most curious and instructive events in the religious history of
  the preceding century are the rise and progress of two new sects called
  Mormons and Positivists. To the student who has carefully considered
  these remarkable phenomena nothing in the records of religious
  self-delusion can appear improbable.</p>

  <p>The Mormons arose in the midst of the great Republic, which, though
  comparatively insignificant, at that time, in territory as in the number
  of its citizens, was (as we know from the fragments of the speeches of
  its orators which have come down to us) no less remarkable for the native
  intelligence of its population than for the wide extent of their
  information, owing to the activity of their publishers in diffusing all
  that they could invent, beg, borrow, or steal. Nor were they less noted
  for their perfect freedom from all restraints in thought, or speech, or
  deed; except, to be sure, the beneficent and wise influence of the
  majority, exerted, in case of need, through an institution known as
  "tarring and feathering," the exact nature of which is now disputed.</p>

  <p>There is a complete consensus of testimony that the founder of
  Mormonism, one Joseph Smith, was a low-minded, ignorant scamp, and that
  he stole the <!-- Page 374 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page374"></a>{374}</span>"Scriptures" which he propounded; not
  being clever enough to forge even such contemptible stuff as they
  contain. Nevertheless he must have been a man of some force of character,
  for a considerable number of disciples soon gathered about him. In spite
  of repeated outbursts of popular hatred and violence&mdash;during one of
  which persecutions Smith was brutally murdered&mdash;the Mormon body
  steadily increased, and became a flourishing community. But the Mormon
  practices being objectionable to the majority, they were, more than once,
  without any pretence of law, but by force of riot, arson, and murder,
  driven away from the land they had occupied. Harried by these
  persecutions, the Mormon body eventually committed itself to the tender
  mercies of a desert as barren as that of Sinai; and after terrible
  sufferings and privations, reached the Oasis of Utah. Here it grew and
  flourished, sending out missionaries to, and receiving converts from, all
  parts of Europe, sometimes to the number of 10,000 in a year; until in
  1880 the rich and flourishing community numbered 110,000 souls in Utah
  alone, while there were probably 30,000 or 40,000 scattered abroad
  elsewhere. In the whole history of religions there is no more remarkable
  example of the power of faith; and, in this case, the founder of that
  faith was indubitably a most despicable creature. It is interesting to
  observe that the course taken by the great Republic and its citizens runs
  exactly parallel with that taken by the Roman Empire and its citizens
  towards the early Christians, except that the Romans had a certain legal
  excuse for <!-- Page 375 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page375"></a>{375}</span>their acts of violence, inasmuch as the
  Christian "sodalitia" were not licensed, and consequently were, <i>ipso
  facto</i>, illegal assemblages. Until, in the latter part of the
  nineteenth century, the United States legislature decreed the illegality
  of polygamy, the Mormons were wholly within the law.</p>

  <p>Nothing can present a greater contrast to all this than the history of
  the Positivists. This sect arose much about the same time as that of the
  Mormons, in the upper and most instructed stratum of the quick-witted,
  sceptical population of Paris. The founder, Auguste Comte, was a teacher
  of mathematics, but of no eminence in that department of knowledge, and
  with nothing but an amateur's acquaintance with physical, chemical, and
  biological science. His works are repulsive on account of the dull
  diffuseness of their style, and a certain air, as of a superior person,
  which characterises them; but nevertheless they contain good things here
  and there. It would take too much space to reproduce in detail a system
  which proposes to regulate all human life by the promulgation of a
  Gentile Leviticus. Suffice it to say, that M. Comte may be described as a
  syncretic, who, like the Gnostics of early Church history, attempted to
  combine the substance of imperfectly comprehended contemporary science
  with the form of Roman Christianity. It may be that this is the reason
  why his disciples were so very angry with some obscure people called
  Agnostics, whose views, if we may judge by the account left in the works
  of a great Positivist controversial writer, were very absurd. <!-- Page
  376 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page376"></a>{376}</span></p>

  <p>To put the matter briefly, M. Comte, finding Christianity and Science
  at daggers drawn, seems to have said to Science, "You find Christianity
  rotten at the core, do you? Well, I will scoop out the inside of it." And
  to Romanism: "You find Science mere dry light&mdash;cold and bare. Well,
  I will put your shell over it, and so, as schoolboys make a spectre out
  of a turnip and a tallow candle, behold the new religion of Humanity
  complete!"</p>

  <p>Unfortunately neither the Romanists nor the people who were something
  more than amateurs in science, could be got to worship M. Comte's new
  idol properly. In the native country of Positivism, one distinguished man
  of letters and one of science, for a time, helped to make up a roomful of
  the faithful, but their love soon grew cold. In England, on the other
  hand, there appears to be little doubt that, in the ninth decade of the
  century, the multitude of disciples reached the grand total of several
  score. They had the advantage of the advocacy of one or two most eloquent
  and learned apostles, and, at any rate, the sympathy of several persons
  of light and leading&mdash;and, if they were not seen, they were heard
  all over the world. On the other hand, as a sect, they laboured under the
  prodigious disadvantage of being refined, estimable people, living in the
  midst of the worn-out civilisation of the old world; where any one who
  had tried to persecute them, as the Mormons were persecuted, would have
  been instantly hanged. But the majority never dreamed of persecuting
  them; on the contrary, they were rather <!-- Page 377 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page377"></a>{377}</span>given to scold and
  otherwise try the patience of the majority.</p>

  <p>The history of these sects in the closing years of the century is
  highly instructive. Mormonism ...</p>

  <p>But I find I have suddenly slipped off Mr. Harrison's tripod, which I
  had borrowed for the occasion. The fact is, I am not equal to the
  prophetical business, and ought not to have undertaken it.</p>

<h3>THE VALUE OF WITNESS TO THE MIRACULOUS</h3>

  <p>Charles, or, more properly, Karl, King of the Franks, consecrated
  Roman Emperor in St. Peter's on Christmas Day, <span
  class="scac">A.D.</span> 800, and known to posterity as the Great
  (chiefly by his agglutinative Gallicised denomination of Charlemagne),
  was a man great in all ways, physically and mentally. Within a couple of
  centuries after his death Charlemagne became the centre of innumerable
  legends; and the myth-making process does not seem to have been sensibly
  interfered with by the existence of sober and truthful histories of the
  Emperor and of the times which immediately preceded and followed his
  reign, by a contemporary writer who occupied a high and confidential
  position in his court, and in that of his successor. This was one
  Eginhard, or Einhard, who appears to have been born about <span
  class="scac">A.D.</span> 770, and spent his youth at the court, being
  educated along with Charles's sons. There is excellent contemporary
  testimony not only to Eginhard's existence, but to his abilities, and to
  the place which he occupied in the circle of the intimate friends of the
  great ruler whose life he subsequently wrote. <!-- Page 379 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page379"></a>{379}</span>In fact, there is as
  good evidence of Eginhard's existence, of his official position, and of
  his being the author of the chief works attributed to him, as can
  reasonably be expected in the case of a man who lived more than a
  thousand years ago, and was neither a great king nor a great warrior. The
  works are&mdash;1. <i>The Life of the Emperor Karl.</i> 2. <i>The Annals
  of the Franks.</i> 3. <i>Letters.</i> 4. <i>The History of the
  Translation of the Blessed Martyrs of Christ, SS. Marcellinus and
  Petrus.</i></p>

  <p>It is to the last, as one of the most singular and interesting records
  of the period during which the Roman world passed into that of the Middle
  Ages, that I wish to direct attention.<a name="NtA93"
  href="#Nt93"><sup>[93]</sup></a> It was written in the ninth century,
  somewhere, apparently, about the year 830, when Eginhard, ailing in
  health and weary of political life, had withdrawn to the monastery of
  Seligenstadt, of which he was the founder. A manuscript copy of the work,
  made in the tenth century, and once the property of the monastery of St.
  Bavon on the Scheldt, of which Eginhard was Abbot, is still extant, and
  there is no reason to believe that, in this copy, the original has been
  in any way interpolated or otherwise tampered with. The main features of
  the strange story contained in the <i>Historia Translationis</i> are set
  forth in the following pages, in which, in regard to all matters of
  importance, I shall adhere as closely as possible to Eginhard's own
  words.</p>

<p><!-- Page 380 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page380"></a>{380}</span></p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>While I was still at Court, busied with secular affairs, I often
  thought of the leisure which I hoped one day to enjoy in a solitary
  place, far away from the crowd, with which the liberality of Prince
  Louis, whom I then served, had provided me. This place is situated in
  that part of Germany which lies between the Neckar and the Maine,<a
  name="NtA94" href="#Nt94"><sup>[94]</sup></a> and is nowadays called the
  Odenwald by those who live in and about it. And here having built,
  according to my capacity and resources, not only houses and permanent
  dwellings, but also a basilica fitted for the performance of divine
  service and of no mean style of construction, I began to think to what
  saint or martyr I could best dedicate it. A good deal of time had passed
  while my thoughts fluctuated about this matter, when it happened that a
  certain deacon of the Roman Church, named Deusdona, arrived at the Court
  for the purpose of seeking the favour of the King in some affairs in
  which he was interested. He remained some time; and then, having
  transacted his business, he was about to return to Rome, when one day,
  moved by courtesy to a stranger, we invited him to a modest refection;
  and while talking of many things at table, mention was made of the
  translation of the body of the blessed Sebastian,<a name="NtA95"
  href="#Nt95"><sup>[95]</sup></a> and of the neglected tombs of the
  martyrs, of which there is such a prodigious number at Rome; and the
  conversation having turned towards the dedication of our new basilica, I
  began to inquire how it might be possible for me to obtain some of the
  true relics of the saints which rest at Rome. He at first hesitated, and
  declared that he did not know how that could be done. But observing that
  I was both anxious and curious about the subject, he promised to give me
  an answer some other day.</p>

  <p>When I returned to the question some time afterwards, he immediately
  drew from his bosom a paper, which he begged me to read when I was alone,
  and to tell him what I was disposed to think of that which was therein
  stated. I took the paper and, as he desired, read it alone and in secret.
  (Cap. i. 2, 3.)</p>

</blockquote>

<p><!-- Page 381 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page381"></a>{381}</span></p>

  <p>I shall have occasion to return to Deacon Deusdona's conditions, and
  to what happened after Eginhard's acceptance of them. Suffice it, for the
  present, to say that Eginhard's notary, Ratleicus (Ratleig), was
  despatched to Rome and succeeded in securing two bodies, supposed to be
  those of the holy martyrs Marcellinus and Petrus; and when he had got as
  far on his homeward journey as the Burgundian town of Solothurn, or
  Soleure,<a name="NtA96" href="#Nt96"><sup>[96]</sup></a> notary Ratleig
  despatched to his master, at St. Bavon, a letter announcing the success
  of his mission.</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>As soon as by reading it I was assured of the arrival of the saints, I
  despatched a confidential messenger to Maestricht to gather together
  priests, other clerics, and also laymen, to go out to meet the coming
  saints as speedily as possible. And he and his companions, having lost no
  time, after a few days met those who had charge of the saints at
  Solothurn. Joined with them, and with a vast crowd of people who gathered
  from all parts, singing hymns, and amidst great and universal rejoicings,
  they travelled quickly to the city of Argentoratum, which is now called
  Strasburg. Thence embarking on the Rhine, they came to the place called
  Portus,<a name="NtA97" href="#Nt97"><sup>[97]</sup></a> and landing on
  the east bank of the river, at the fifth station thence they arrived at
  Michilinstadt,<a name="NtA98" href="#Nt98"><sup>[98]</sup></a>
  accompanied by an immense multitude, praising God. This place is in that
  forest of Germany which in modern times is called the Odenwald, and about
  six leagues from the Maine. And here, having found a basilica recently
  built by me, but not yet consecrated, they carried the sacred remains
  into it and deposited them therein, as if it were to be their final
  resting-place. As soon as all this was reported to me I travelled thither
  as quickly as I could. (Cap. ii. 14.)</p>

</blockquote>

<p><!-- Page 382 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page382"></a>{382}</span></p>

  <p>Three days after Eginhard's arrival began the series of wonderful
  events which he narrates, and for which we have his personal guarantee.
  The first thing that he notices is the dream of a servant of Ratleig, the
  notary, who, being set to watch the holy relics in the church after
  vespers, went to sleep, and during his slumbers had a vision of two
  pigeons, one white and one gray and white, which came and sat upon the
  bier over the relics; while, at the same time, a voice ordered the man to
  tell his master that the holy martyrs had chosen another resting-place
  and desired to be transported thither without delay.</p>

  <p>Unfortunately, the saints seem to have forgotten to mention where they
  wished to go; and, with the most anxious desire to gratify their smallest
  wishes, Eginhard was naturally greatly perplexed what to do. While in
  this state of mind, he was one day contemplating his "great and wonderful
  treasure, more precious than all the gold in the world," when it struck
  him that the chest in which the relics were contained was quite unworthy
  of its contents; and after vespers he gave orders to one of the
  sacristans to take the measure of the chest in order that a more fitting
  shrine might be constructed. The man, having lighted a wax candle and
  raised the pall which covered the relics, in order to carry out his
  master's orders, was astonished and terrified to observe that the chest
  was covered with a blood-like exudation (<i>loculum mirum in modum humore
  sanguineo undique distillantem</i>), and at once sent a message to
  Eginhard. <!-- Page 383 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page383"></a>{383}</span></p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>Then I and those priests who accompanied me beheld this stupendous
  miracle, worthy of all admiration. For just as when it is going to rain,
  pillars and slabs and marble images exude moisture, and, as it were
  sweat, so the chest which contained the most sacred relics was found
  moist with the blood exuding on all sides. (Cap. ii. 16.)</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>Three days' fast was ordained in order that the meaning of the portent
  might be ascertained. All that happened, however, was that at the end of
  that time the "blood," which had been exuding in drops all the while,
  dried up. Eginhard is careful to say that the liquid "had a saline taste,
  something like that of tears, and was thin as water, though of the colour
  of true blood," and he clearly thinks this satisfactory evidence that it
  was blood.</p>

  <p>The same night another servant had a vision, in which still more
  imperative orders for the removal of the relics were given; and, from
  that time forth, "not a single night passed without one, two, or even
  three of our companions receiving revelations in dreams that the bodies
  of the saints were to be transferred from that place to another." At last
  a priest, Hildfrid, saw, in a dream, a venerable white-haired man in a
  priest's vestments, who bitterly reproached Eginhard for not obeying the
  repeated orders of the saints, and upon this the journey was commenced.
  Why Eginhard delayed obedience to these repeated visions so long does not
  appear. He does not say so in so many words, but the general tenor of the
  narrative leads one to suppose that Mulinheim (afterwards Seligenstadt)
  is the "solitary place" in which he had built the church which awaited
  dedication. <!-- Page 384 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page384"></a>{384}</span>In that case, all the people about him
  would know that he desired that the saints should go there. If a
  glimmering of secular sense led him to be a little suspicious about the
  real cause of the unanimity of the visionary beings who manifested
  themselves to his <i>entourage</i> in favour of moving on, he does not
  say so.</p>

  <p>At the end of the first day's journey the precious relics were
  deposited in the church of St. Martin, in the village of Ostheim. Hither
  a paralytic nun (<i>sanctimonialis quædam paralytica</i>) of the name of
  Ruodlang was brought in a car by her friends and relatives from a
  monastery a league off. She spent the night watching and praying by the
  bier of the saints; "and health returning to all her members, on the
  morrow she went back to her place whence she came, on her feet, nobody
  supporting her, or in any way giving her assistance." (Cap. ii. 19.)</p>

  <p>On the second day, the relics were carried to Upper Mulinheim, and
  finally, in accordance with the orders of the martyrs, deposited in the
  church of that place, which was therefore renamed Seligenstadt. Here,
  Daniel, a beggar boy of fifteen, and so bent that "he could not look at
  the sky without lying on his back," collapsed and fell down during the
  celebration of the Mass. "Thus he lay a long time, as if asleep, and all
  his limbs straightening and his flesh strengthening (<i>recepta firmitate
  nervorum</i>), he arose before our eyes, quite well." (Cap. ii. 20.)</p>

  <p>Some time afterwards an old man entered the church on his hands and
  knees, being unable to use his limbs properly:&mdash; <!-- Page 385
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page385"></a>{385}</span></p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>He, in presence of all of us, by the power of God and the merits of
  the blessed martyrs, in the same hour in which he entered was so
  perfectly cured that he walked without so much as a stick. And he said
  that, though he had been deaf for five years, his deafness had ceased
  along with the palsy. (Cap. iii. 33.)</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>Eginhard was now obliged to return to the Court at Aix-la-Chapelle,
  where his duties kept him through the winter; and he is careful to point
  out that the later miracles which he proceeds to speak of are known to
  him only at second hand. But, as he naturally observes, having seen such
  wonderful events with his own eyes, why should he doubt similar
  narrations when they are received from trustworthy sources?</p>

  <p>Wonderful stories these are indeed, but as they are, for the most
  part, of the same general character as those already recounted, they may
  be passed over. There is, however, an account of a possessed maiden which
  is worth attention. This is set forth in a memoir, the principal contents
  of which are the speeches of a demon who declared himself to possess the
  singular appellation of "Wiggo," and revealed himself in the presence of
  many witnesses, before the altar, close to the relics of the blessed
  martyrs. It is noteworthy that the revelations appear to have been made
  in the shape of replies to the questions of the exorcising priest, and
  there is no means of judging how far the answers are, really, only the
  questions to which the patient replied yes or no.</p>

  <p>The possessed girl, about sixteen years of age, was brought by her
  parents to the basilica of the martyrs. <!-- Page 386 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page386"></a>{386}</span></p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>When she approached the tomb containing the sacred bodies, the priest,
  according to custom, read the formula of exorcism over her head. When he
  began to ask how and when the demon had entered her, she answered, not in
  the tongue of the barbarians, which alone the girl knew, but in the Roman
  tongue. And when the priest was astonished and asked how she came to know
  Latin, when her parents, who stood by, were wholly ignorant of it, "Thou
  hast never seen my parents," was the reply. To this the priest, "Whence
  art thou, then, if these are not thy parents?" And the demon, by the

  time I was gatekeeper (janitor) in hell; but, for some years, along with
  eleven companions, I have ravaged the kingdom of the Franks." (Cap. v.
  49.)</p>

  this, he threw the girl down on the floor and there compelled her to lie
  prostrate for a time, as though she slumbered. After a little while,
  however, he going away, the girl, by the power of Christ and the merits

  <p>If the <i>Historia Translationis</i> contained nothing more than has
  been, at present, laid before the reader, disbelief in the miracles of
  which it gives so precise and full a record might well be regarded as
  hyper-scepticism. It might fairly be said, Here you have a man, whose
  high character, acute intelligence, and large instruction are certified
  by eminent contemporaries; a man who stood high in the confidence of one
  of the greatest rulers of any age, and whose other works prove him to be
  an accurate and judicious narrator of ordinary events. This man tells
  you, in language which bears the stamp of sincerity, of things which
  happened within his own knowledge, or within that of persons in whose
  veracity he has entire confidence, while he appeals to his sovereign and
  the court as witnesses of others; what possible ground can there be for
  disbelieving him?</p>

  <p>Well, it is hard upon Eginhard to say so, but it is exactly the
  honesty and sincerity of the man which are his undoing as a witness to
  the miraculous. He himself makes it quite obvious that when his profound
  piety comes on the stage, his good sense and even his perception of right
  and wrong make their exit. Let us go back to the point at which we left
  him, secretly perusing the letter of Deacon Deusdona. As he tells us, its
  contents were</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>that he [the deacon] had many relics of saints at home, and that he
  would give them to me if I would furnish him with the means of returning
  to Rome; he had observed that I had two mules, and if I would let him
  have one of them and would despatch with him a confidential servant to
  take charge of the <!-- Page 388 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page388"></a>{388}</span>relics, he would at once send them to me.
  This plausibly expressed proposition pleased me, and I made up my mind to
  test the value of the somewhat ambiguous promise at once;<a name="NtA100"
  href="#Nt100"><sup>[100]</sup></a> so giving him the mule and money for
  his journey I ordered my notary Ratleig (who already desired to go to
  Rome to offer his devotions there) to go with him. Therefore, having left
  Aix-la-Chapelle (where the Emperor and his Court resided at the time)
  they came to Soissons. Here they spoke with Hildoin, abbot of the
  monastery of St. Medardus, because the said deacon had assured him that
  he had the means of placing in his possession the body of the blessed
  Tiburtius the Martyr. Attracted by which promises he (Hildoin) sent with
  them a certain priest, Hunus by name, a sharp man (<i>hominem
  callidum</i>), whom he ordered to receive and bring back the body of the
  martyr in question. And so, resuming their journey, they proceeded to
  Rome as fast as they could. (Cap. i. 3.)</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>Unfortunately, a servant of the notary, one Reginbald, fell ill of a
  tertian fever, and impeded the progress of the party. However, this piece
  of adversity had its sweet uses; for three days before they reached Rome,
  Reginbald had a vision. Somebody habited as a deacon appeared to him and
  asked why his master was in such a hurry to get to Rome; and when
  Reginbald explained their business, this visionary deacon, who seems to
  have taken the measure of his brother in the flesh with some accuracy,
  told him not by any means to expect that Deusdona would fulfil his
  promises. Moreover, taking the servant by the hand, he led him to the top
  of a high mountain and, showing him Rome (where the man had never been),
  pointed <!-- Page 389 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page389"></a>{389}</span>out a church, adding "Tell Ratleig the
  thing he wants is hidden there; let him get it as quickly as he can and
  go back to his master;" and, by way of a sign that the order was
  authoritative, the servant was promised that from that time forth his
  fever should disappear. And as the fever did vanish to return no more,
  the faith of Eginhard's people in Deacon Deusdona naturally vanished with
  it (<i>et fidem diaconi promissis non haberent</i>). Nevertheless, they
  put up at the deacon's house near St. Peter ad Vincula. But time went on
  and no relics made their appearance, while the notary and the priest were
  put off with all sorts of excuses&mdash;the brother to whom the relics
  had been confided was gone to Beneventum and not expected back for some
  time, and so on&mdash;until Ratleig and Hunus began to despair, and were
  minded to return, <i>infecto negotio</i>.</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>But my notary, calling to mind his servant's dream, proposed to his
  companion that they should go to the cemetery which their host had talked
  about without him. So, having found and hired a guide, they went in the
  first place to the basilica of the blessed Tiburtius in the Via Labicana,
  about three thousand paces from the town, and cautiously and carefully
  inspected the tomb of that martyr, in order to discover whether it could
  be opened without any one being the wiser. Then they descended into the
  adjoining crypt, in which the bodies of the blessed martyrs of Christ,
  Marcellinus and Petrus were buried; and, having made out the nature of
  their tomb, they went away thinking their host would not know what they
  had been about. But things fell out differently from what they had
  imagined. (Cap. i. 7.)</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>In fact, Deacon Deusdona, who doubtless kept an eye on his guests,
  knew all about their man&oelig;uvres and made haste to offer his
  services, in order that <!-- Page 390 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page390"></a>{390}</span>"with the help of God" (<i>si Deus votis
  eorum favere dignaretur</i>), they should all work together. The deacon
  was evidently alarmed lest they should succeed without <i>his</i>
  help.</p>

  <p>So, by way of preparation for the contemplated <i>vol avec
  effraction</i> they fasted three days; and then, at night, without being
  seen, they betook themselves to the basilica of St. Tiburtius, and tried
  to break open the altar erected over his remains. But the marble proving
  too solid, they descended to the crypt, and "having evoked our Lord Jesus
  Christ and adored the holy martyrs," they proceeded to prise off the
  stone which covered the tomb, and thereby exposed the body of the most
  sacred martyr Marcellinus, "whose head rested on a marble tablet on which
  his name was inscribed." The body was taken up with the greatest
  veneration, wrapped in a rich covering, and given over to the keeping of
  the deacon and his brother, Lunison, while the stone was replaced with
  such care that no sign of the theft remained.</p>

  <p>As sacrilegious proceedings of this kind were punishable with death by
  the Roman law, it seems not unnatural that Deacon Deusdona should have
  become uneasy, and have urged Ratleig to be satisfied with what he had
  got and be off with his spoils. But the notary having thus cleverly
  captured the blessed Marcellinus, thought it a pity he should be parted
  from the blessed Petrus, side by side with whom he had rested for five
  hundred years and more in the same sepulchre (as Eginhard pathetically
  <!-- Page 391 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page391"></a>{391}</span>observes); and the pious man could neither
  eat, drink, nor sleep, until he had compassed his desire to re-unite the
  saintly colleagues. This time, apparently in consequence of Deusdona's
  opposition to any further resurrectionist doings, he took counsel with a
  Greek monk, one Basil, and, accompanied by Hunus, but saying nothing to
  Deusdona, they committed another sacrilegious burglary, securing this
  time, not only the body of the blessed Petrus, but a quantity of dust,
  which they agreed the priest should take, and tell his employer that it
  was the remains of the blessed Tiburtius. How Deusdona was "squared," and
  what he got for his not very valuable complicity in these transactions,
  does not appear. But at last the relics were sent off in charge of
  Lunison, the brother of Deusdona, and the priest Hunus, as far as Pavia,
  while Ratleig stopped behind for a week to see if the robbery was
  discovered, and, presumably, to act as a blind if any hue and cry was
  raised. But, as everything remained quiet, the notary betook himself to
  Pavia, where he found Lunison and Hunus awaiting his arrival. The
  notary's opinion of the character of his worthy colleagues, however, may
  be gathered from the fact that, having persuaded them to set out in
  advance along a road which he told them he was about to take, he
  immediately adopted another route, and, travelling by way of St. Maurice
  and the Lake of Geneva, eventually reached Soleure.</p>

  <p>Eginhard tells all this story with the most naïve air of
  unconsciousness that there is anything remarkable about an abbot, and a
  high officer of state to <!-- Page 392 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page392"></a>{392}</span>boot, being an accessory, both before and
  after the fact, to a most gross and scandalous act of sacrilegious and
  burglarious robbery. And an amusing sequel to the story proves that,
  where relics were concerned, his friend Hildoin, another high
  ecclesiastical dignitary, was even less scrupulous than himself.</p>

  <p>On going to the palace early one morning, after the saints were safely
  bestowed at Seligenstadt, he found Hildoin waiting for an audience in the
  Emperor's antechamber, and began to talk to him about the miracle of the
  bloody exudation. In the course of conversation, Eginhard happened to
  allude to the remarkable fineness of the garment of the blessed
  Marcellinus. Whereupon Abbot Hildoin observed (to Eginhard's
  stupefaction) that his observation was quite correct. Much astonished at
  this remark from a person who was supposed not to have seen the relics,
  Eginhard asked him how he knew that? Upon this, Hildoin saw that he had
  better make a clean breast of it, and he told the following story, which
  he had received from his priestly agent, Hunus. While Hunus and Lunison
  were at Pavia, waiting for Eginhard's notary, Hunus (according to his own
  account) had robbed the robbers. The relics were placed in a church and a
  number of laymen and clerics, of whom Hunus was one, undertook to keep
  watch over them. One night, however, all the watchers, save the
  wide-awake Hunus, went to sleep; and then, according to the story which
  this "sharp" ecclesiastic foisted upon his patron, <!-- Page 393 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page393"></a>{393}</span></p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>it was borne in upon his mind that there must be some great reason why
  all the people, except himself, had suddenly become somnolent; and,
  determining to avail himself of the opportunity thus offered (<i>oblata
  occasione utendum</i>), he rose and, having lighted a candle, silently
  approached the chests. Then, having burnt through the threads of the
  seals with the flame of the candle, he quickly opened the chests, which
  had no locks;<a name="NtA101" href="#Nt101"><sup>[101]</sup></a> and,
  taking out portions of each of the bodies which were thus exposed, he
  closed the chests and connected the burnt ends of the threads with the
  seals again, so that they appeared not to have been touched; and, no one
  having seen him, he returned to his place. (Cap. iii. 23.)</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>Hildoin went on to tell Eginhard that Hunus at first declared to him
  that these purloined relics belonged to St. Tiburtius; but afterwards
  confessed, as a great secret, how he had come by them, and he wound up
  his discourse thus:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>They have a place of honour beside St. Medardus, where they are
  worshipped with great veneration by all the people; but whether we may
  keep them or not is for your judgment. (Cap. iii. 23.)</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>Poor Eginhard was thrown into a state of great perturbation of mind by
  this revelation. An acquaintance of his had recently told him of a rumour
  that was spread about that Hunus had contrived to abstract <i>all</i> the
  remains of SS. Marcellinus and Petrus while Eginhard's agents were in a
  drunken sleep; and that, while the real relics were in Abbot Hildoin's
  hands at St. Medardus, the shrine at Seligenstadt contained nothing but a
  little dust. Though greatly annoyed by this "execrable rumour, spread
  <!-- Page 394 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page394"></a>{394}</span>everywhere by the subtlety of the devil,"
  Eginhard had doubtless comforted himself by his supposed knowledge of its
  falsity, and he only now discovered how considerable a foundation there
  was for the scandal. There was nothing for it but to insist upon the
  return of the stolen treasures. One would have thought that the holy man,
  who had admitted himself to be knowingly a receiver of stolen goods,
  would have made instant restitution and begged only for absolution. But
  Eginhard intimates that he had very great difficulty in getting his
  brother abbot to see that even restitution was necessary.</p>

  <p>Hildoin's proceedings were not of such a nature as to lead any one to
  place implicit confidence in anything he might say; still less had his
  agent, priest Hunus, established much claim to confidence; and it is not
  surprising that Eginhard should have lost no time in summoning his notary
  and Lunison to his presence, in order that he might hear what they had to
  say about the business. They, however, at once protested that priest
  Hunus's story was a parcel of lies, and that after the relics left Rome
  no one had any opportunity of meddling with them. Moreover, Lunison,
  throwing himself at Eginhard's feet, confessed with many tears what
  actually took place. It will be remembered that after the body of St.
  Marcellinus was abstracted from its tomb, Ratleig deposited it in the
  house of Deusdona, in charge of the latter's brother, Lunison. But Hunus,
  being very much disappointed that he could not get hold of the body of
  St. Tiburtius, and afraid to go back to his <!-- Page 395 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page395"></a>{395}</span>abbot empty-handed,
  bribed Lunison with four pieces of gold and five of silver to give him
  access to the chest. This Lunison did, and Hunus helped himself to as
  much as would fill a gallon measure (<i>vas sextarii mensuram</i>) of the
  sacred remains. Eginhard's indignation at the "rapine" of this
  "nequissimus nebulo" is exquisitely droll. It would appear that the adage
  about the receiver being as bad as the thief was not current in the ninth
  century.</p>

  <p>&nbsp;</p>

  <p>Let us now briefly sum up the history of the acquisition of the
  relics. Eginhard makes a contract with Deusdona for the delivery of
  certain relics which the latter says he possesses. Eginhard makes no
  inquiry how he came by them; otherwise, the transaction is innocent
  enough.</p>

  <p>Deusdona turns out to be a swindler, and has no relics. Thereupon
  Eginhard's agent, after due fasting and prayer, breaks open the tombs and
  helps himself.</p>

  <p>Eginhard discovers by the self-betrayal of his brother abbot, Hildoin,
  that portions of his relics have been stolen and conveyed to the latter.
  With much ado he succeeds in getting them back.</p>

  <p>Hildoin's agent, Hunus, in delivering these stolen goods to him, at
  first declared they were the relics of St. Tiburtius, which Hildoin
  desired him to obtain; but afterwards invented a story of their being the
  product of a theft, which the providential drowsiness of his companions
  enabled him to perpetrate, from the relics which Hildoin well knew were
  the property of his friend. <!-- Page 396 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page396"></a>{396}</span></p>

  <p>Lunison, on the contrary, swears that all this story is false, and
  that he himself was bribed by Hunus to allow him to steal what he pleased
  from the property confided to his own and his brother's care by their
  guest Ratleig. And the honest notary himself seems to have no hesitation
  about lying and stealing to any extent, where the acquisition of relics
  is the object in view.</p>

  <p>For a parallel to these transactions one must read a police report of
  the doings of a "long firm" or of a set of horse-coupers; yet Eginhard
  seems to be aware of nothing, but that he has been rather badly used by
  his friend Hildoin, and the "nequissimus nebulo" Hunus.</p>

  <p>It is not easy for a modern Protestant, still less for any one who has
  the least tincture of scientific culture, whether physical or historical,
  to picture to himself the state of mind of a man of the ninth century,
  however cultivated, enlightened, and sincere he may have been. His
  deepest convictions, his most cherished hopes, were bound up with the
  belief in the miraculous. Life was a constant battle between saints and
  demons for the possession of the souls of men. The most superstitious
  among our modern countrymen turn to supernatural agencies only when
  natural causes seem insufficient; to Eginhard and his friends the
  supernatural was the rule, and the sufficiency of natural causes was
  allowed only when there was nothing to suggest others.</p>

  <p>Moreover, it must be recollected that the possession of
  miracle-working relics was greatly coveted, <!-- Page 397 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page397"></a>{397}</span>not only on high, but
  on very low grounds. To a man like Eginhard, the mere satisfaction of the
  religious sentiment was obviously a powerful attraction. But, more than
  this, the possession of such a treasure was an immense practical
  advantage. If the saints were duly flattered and worshipped, there was no
  telling what benefits might result from their interposition on your
  behalf. For physical evils, access to the shrine was like the grant of
  the use of a universal pill and ointment manufactory; and pilgrimages
  thereto might suffice to cleanse the performers from any amount of sin. A
  letter to Lupus, subsequently Abbot of Ferrara, written while Eginhard
  was smarting under the grief caused by the loss of his much-loved wife
  Imma, affords a striking insight into the current view of the relation
  between the glorified saints and their worshippers. The writer shows that
  he is anything but satisfied with the way in which he has been treated by
  the blessed martyrs whose remains he has taken such pains to "convey" to
  Seligenstadt, and to honour there as they would never have been honoured
  in their Roman obscurity.</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>It is an aggravation of my grief and a reopening of my wound, that our
  vows have been of no avail, and that the faith which we placed in the
  merits and intervention of the martyrs has been utterly disappointed.</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>We may admit, then, without impeachment of Eginhard's sincerity, or of
  his honour under all ordinary circumstances, that when piety,
  self-interest, the glory of the Church in general, and that of the church
  at Seligenstadt in particular, all pulled one way, <!-- Page 398 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page398"></a>{398}</span>even the workaday
  principles of morality were disregarded; and, <i>à fortiori</i>, anything
  like proper investigation of the reality of alleged miracles was thrown
  to the winds.</p>

  <p>And if this was the condition of mind of such a man as Eginhard, what
  is it not legitimate to suppose may have been that of Deacon Deusdona,
  Lunison, Hunus, and Company, thieves and cheats by their own confession,
  or of the probably hysterical nun, or of the professional beggars, for
  whose incapacity to walk and straighten themselves there is no guarantee
  but their own? Who is to make sure that the exorcist of the demon Wiggo
  was not just such another priest as Hunus; and is it not at least
  possible, when Eginhard's servants dreamed, night after night, in such a
  curiously coincident fashion, that a careful inquirer might have found
  they were very anxious to please their master?</p>

  <p>Quite apart from deliberate and conscious fraud (which is a rarer
  thing than is often supposed), people, whose mythop&oelig;ic faculty is
  once stirred, are capable of saying the thing that is not, and of acting
  as they should not, to an extent which is hardly imaginable by persons
  who are not so easily affected by the contagion of blind faith. There is
  no falsity so gross that honest men and, still more, virtuous women,
  anxious to promote a good cause, will not lend themselves to it without
  any clear consciousness of the moral bearings of what they are doing.</p>

  <p>The cases of miraculously-effected cures of which Eginhard is ocular
  witness appear to belong to classes <!-- Page 399 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page399"></a>{399}</span>of disease in which
  malingering is possible or hysteria presumable. Without modern means of
  diagnosis, the names given to them are quite worthless. One "miracle,"
  however, in which the patient, a woman, was cured by the mere sight of
  the church in which the relics of the blessed martyrs lay, is an
  unmistakable case of dislocation of the lower jaw; and it is obvious
  that, as not unfrequently happens in such accidents in weakly subjects,
  the jaw slipped suddenly back into place, perhaps in consequence of a
  jolt, as the woman rode towards the church. (Cap. v. 53.)<a name="NtA102"
  href="#Nt102"><sup>[102]</sup></a></p>

  <p>There is also a good deal said about a very questionable blind
  man&mdash;one Albricus (Alberich?)&mdash;who, having been cured, not of
  his blindness, but of another disease under which he laboured, took up
  his quarters at Seligenstadt, and came out as a prophet, inspired by the
  Archangel Gabriel. Eginhard intimates that his prophecies were fulfilled;
  but as he does not state exactly what they were or how they were
  accomplished, the statement must be accepted with much caution. It is
  obvious that he was not the man to hesitate to "ease" a prophecy until it
  fitted, if the credit of the shrine of his favourite saints could be
  increased by such a procedure. There is no impeachment of his honour in
  the supposition. The logic of the matter is quite simple, if somewhat
  sophistical. The holiness of the church of the martyrs guarantees <!--
  Page 400 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page400"></a>{400}</span>the
  reality of the appearance of the Archangel Gabriel there, and what the
  archangel says must be true. Therefore, if anything seem to be wrong,
  that must be the mistake of the transmitter; and, in justice to the
  archangel, it must be suppressed or set right. This sort of
  "reconciliation" is not unknown in quite modern times, and among people
  who would be very much shocked to be compared with a "benighted papist"
  of the ninth century.</p>

  <p>The readers of this essay are, I imagine, very largely composed of
  people who would be shocked to be regarded as anything but enlightened
  Protestants. It is not unlikely that those of them who have accompanied
  me thus far may be disposed to say, "Well, this is all very amusing as a
  story, but what is the practical interest of it? We are not likely to
  believe in the miracles worked by the spolia of SS. Marcellinus and
  Petrus, or by those of any other saints in the Roman Calendar."</p>

  <p>The practical interest is this: if you do not believe in these
  miracles recounted by a witness whose character and competency are firmly
  established, whose sincerity cannot be doubted, and who appeals to his
  sovereign and other contemporaries as witnesses of the truth of what he
  says, in a document of which a MS. copy exists, probably dating within a
  century of the author's death, why do you profess to believe in stories
  of a like character, which are found in documents of the dates and of the
  authorship of which nothing is certainly determined, and no known copies
  of which come within two or three centuries of the <!-- Page 401 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page401"></a>{401}</span>events they record. If
  it be true that the four Gospels and the Acts were written by Matthew,
  Mark, Luke, and John, all that we know of these persons comes to nothing
  in comparison with our knowledge of Eginhard; and not only is there no
  proof that the traditional authors of these works wrote them, but very
  strong reasons to the contrary may be alleged. If, therefore, you refuse
  to believe that "Wiggo" was cast out of the possessed girl on Eginhard's
  authority, with what justice can you profess to believe that the legion
  of devils were cast out of the man among the tombs of the Gadarenes? And
  if, on the other hand, you accept Eginhard's evidence, why do you laugh
  at the supposed efficacy of relics and the saint-worship of the modern
  Romanists? It cannot be pretended, in the face of all evidence, that the
  Jews of the year 30 <span class="scac">A.D.</span>, or thereabouts, were
  less imbued with the belief in the supernatural than were the Franks of
  the year 800 <span class="scac">A.D.</span> The same influences were at
  work in each case, and it is only reasonable to suppose that the results
  were the same. If the evidence of Eginhard is insufficient to lead
  reasonable men to believe in the miracles he relates, <i>à fortiori</i>
  the evidence afforded by the Gospels and the Acts must be so.<a
  name="NtA103" href="#Nt103"><sup>[103]</sup></a></p>

  <p>But it may be said that no serious critic denies the genuineness of
  the four great Pauline Epistles&mdash;Galatians, First and Second
  Corinthians, and <!-- Page 402 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page402"></a>{402}</span>Romans&mdash;and that in three out of
  these four Paul lays claim to the power of working miracles.<a
  name="NtA104" href="#Nt104"><sup>[104]</sup></a> Must we suppose,
  therefore, that the Apostle to the Gentiles has stated that which is
  false? But to how much does this so-called claim amount? It may mean much
  or little. Paul nowhere tells us what he did in this direction; and, in
  his sore need to justify his assumption of apostleship against the sneers
  of his enemies, it is hardly likely that if he had any very striking
  cases to bring forward he would have neglected evidence so well
  calculated to put them to shame. And, without the slightest impeachment
  of Paul's veracity, we must further remember that his strongly-marked
  mental characteristics, displayed in unmistakable fashion in these
  Epistles, are anything but those which would justify us in regarding him
  as a critical witness respecting matters of fact, or as a trustworthy
  interpreter of their significance. When a man testifies to a miracle, he
  not only states a fact, but he adds an interpretation of the fact. We may
  admit his evidence as to the former, and yet think his opinion as to the
  latter worthless. If Eginhard's calm and objective narrative of the
  historical events of his time is no guarantee for the soundness of his
  judgment where the supernatural is concerned, the heated rhetoric of the
  Apostle of the Gentiles, his absolute confidence in the "inner light,"
  and the extraordinary conceptions of the nature and requirements of
  logical proof which he betrays, in page after page of his Epistles,
  afford still less security.</p>

<p><!-- Page 403 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page403"></a>{403}</span></p>

  <p>There is a comparatively modern man who shared to the full Paul's
  trust in the "inner light," and who, though widely different from the
  fiery evangelist of Tarsus in various obvious particulars, yet, if I am
  not mistaken, shares his deepest characteristics. I speak of George Fox,
  who separated himself from the current Protestantism of England, in the
  seventeenth century, as Paul separated himself from the Judaism of the
  first century, at the bidding of the "inner light"; who went through
  persecutions as serious as those which Paul enumerates; who was beaten,
  stoned, cast out for dead, imprisoned nine times, sometimes for long
  periods; who was in perils on land and perils at sea. George Fox was an
  even more widely travelled missionary; while his success in founding
  congregations, and his energy in visiting them, not merely in Great
  Britain and Ireland and the West India Islands, but on the continent of
  Europe and that of North America, was no less remarkable. A few years
  after Fox began to preach, there were reckoned to be a thousand Friends
  in prison in the various gaols of England; at his death, less than fifty
  years after the foundation of the sect, there were 70,000 Quakers in the
  United Kingdom. The cheerfulness with which these people&mdash;women as
  well as men&mdash;underwent martyrdom in this country and in the New
  England States is one of the most remarkable facts in the history of
  religion.</p>

  <p>No one who reads the voluminous autobiography of "Honest George" can
  doubt the man's utter truthfulness; and though, in his multitudinous
  letters, <!-- Page 404 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page404"></a>{404}</span>he but rarely rises far above the
  incoherent commonplaces of a street preacher, there can be no question of
  his power as a speaker, nor any doubt as to the dignity and
  attractiveness of his personality, or of his possession of a large amount
  of practical good sense and governing faculty.</p>

  <p>But that George Fox had full faith in his own powers as a
  miracle-worker, the following passage of his autobiography (to which
  others might be added) demonstrates:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>Now after I was set at liberty from Nottingham gaol (where I had been
  kept a prisoner a pretty long time) I travelled as before, in the work of
  the Lord. And coming to Mansfield Woodhouse, there was a distracted
  woman, under a doctor's hand, with her hair let loose all about her ears;
  and he was about to let her blood, she being first bound, and many people
  being about her, holding her by violence; but he could get no blood from
  her. And I desired them to unbind her and let her alone; for they could
  not touch the spirit in her by which she was tormented. So they did
  unbind her, and I was moved to speak to her, and in the name of the Lord
  to bid her be quiet and still. And she was so. And the Lord's power
  settled her mind and she mended; and afterwards received the truth and
  continued in it to her death. And the Lord's name was honoured; to whom
  the glory of all his works belongs. Many great and wonderful things were
  wrought by the heavenly power in those days. For the Lord made bare his
  omnipotent arm and manifested his power to the astonishment of many; by
  the healing virtue whereof many have been delivered from great
  infirmities, and the devils were made subject through his name: of which
  particular instances might be given beyond what this unbelieving age is
  able to receive or bear.<a name="NtA105"
  href="#Nt105"><sup>[105]</sup></a></p>

</blockquote>

  <p>It needs no long study of Fox's writings, however, <!-- Page 405
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page405"></a>{405}</span>to arrive at
  the conviction that the distinction between subjective and objective
  verities had not the same place in his mind as it has in that of ordinary
  mortals. When an ordinary person would say "I thought so and so," or "I
  made up my mind to do so and so," George Fox says, "It was opened to me,"
  or "at the command of God I did so and so." "Then at the command of God,
  on the ninth day of the seventh month 1643 (Fox being just nineteen), I
  left my relations and brake off all familiarity or friendship with young
  or old." "About the beginning of the year 1647 I was moved of the Lord to
  go into Darbyshire." Fox hears voices and he sees visions, some of which
  he brings before the reader with apocalyptic power in the simple and
  strong English, alike untutored and undefiled, of which, like John
  Bunyan, his contemporary, he was a master.</p>

  <p>"And one morning, as I was sitting by the fire, a great cloud came
  over me and a temptation beset me; and I sate still. And it was said,
  <i>All things come by Nature</i>. And the elements and stars came over
  me; so that I was in a manner quite clouded with it.... And as I sate
  still under it, and let it alone, a living hope arose in me, and a true
  voice arose in me which said, <i>There is a living God who made all
  things</i>. And immediately the cloud and the temptation vanished away,
  and life rose over it all, and my heart was glad and I praised the living
  God" (p. 13).</p>

  <p>If George Fox could speak, as he proves in this and some other
  passages he could write, his <!-- Page 406 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page406"></a>{406}</span>astounding influence on the contemporaries
  of Milton and of Cromwell is no mystery. But this modern reproduction of
  the ancient prophet, with his "Thus saith the Lord," "This is the work of
  the Lord," steeped in supernaturalism and glorying in blind faith, is the
  mental antipodes of the philosopher, founded in naturalism and a fanatic
  for evidence, to whom these affirmations inevitably suggest the previous
  question: "How do you know that the Lord saith it:" "How do you know that
  the Lord doeth it?" and who is compelled to demand that rational ground
  for belief without which, to the man of science, assent is merely an
  immoral pretence.</p>

  <p>And it is this rational ground of belief which the writers of the
  Gospels, no less than Paul, and Eginhard, and Fox, so little dream of
  offering that they would regard the demand for it as a kind of
  blasphemy.</p>

<h3>XI</h3>

<h3>AGNOSTICISM: A REJOINDER</h3>

  <p>Those who passed from Dr. Wace's article in the last number of this
  Review to the anticipatory confutation of it which followed in "The New
  Reformation," must have enjoyed the pleasure of a dramatic
  surprise&mdash;just as when the fifth act of a new play proves
  unexpectedly bright and interesting. Mrs. Ward will, I hope, pardon the
  comparison, if I say that her effective clearing away of antiquated
  incumbrances from the lists of the controversy, reminds me of nothing so
  much as of the action of some neat-handed, but strong-wristed, Phyllis,
  who, gracefully wielding her long-handled "Turk's head," sweeps away the
  accumulated results of the toil of generations of spiders. I am the more
  indebted to this luminous sketch of the results of critical
  investigation, as it is carried out among those theologians who are men
  of science and not mere counsel for creeds, since it has relieved me from
  the necessity of dealing with the greater part of Dr. Wace's polemic, and
  enables me to devote more space to the really important issues which have
  been raised.<a name="NtA106" href="#Nt106"><sup>[106]</sup></a></p>

<p><!-- Page 408 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page408"></a>{408}</span></p>

  <p>Perhaps, however, it may be well for me to observe that approbation of
  the manner in which a great biblical scholar, for instance, Reuss, does
  his work does not commit me to the adoption of all, or indeed any of his
  views; and, further, that the disagreements of a series of investigators
  do not in any way interfere with the fact that each of them has made
  important contributions to the body of truth ultimately established. If I
  cite Buffon, Linnæus, Lamarck, and Cuvier, as having each and all taken a
  leading share in building up modern biology, the statement that every one
  of these great naturalists disagreed with, and even more or less
  contradicted, all the rest is quite true; but the supposition that the
  latter assertion is in any way inconsistent with the former, would betray
  a strange ignorance of the manner in which all true science advances.</p>

  <p>Dr. Wace takes a great deal of trouble to make it appear that I have
  desired to evade the real questions raised by his attack upon me at the
  Church Congress. I assure the reverend Principal that in this, as in some
  other respects, he has entertained a very erroneous conception of my
  intentions. Things would assume more accurate proportions in Dr. Wace's
  mind if he would kindly remember that it is just thirty years since
  ecclesiastical thunderbolts <!-- Page 409 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page409"></a>{409}</span>began to fly about my ears. I have had the
  "Lion and the Bear" to deal with, and it is long since I got quite used
  to the threatenings of episcopal Goliaths, whose croziers were like unto
  a weaver's beam. So that I almost think I might not have noticed Dr.
  Wace's attack, personal as it was; and although, as he is good enough to
  tell us, separate copies are to be had for the modest equivalent of
  twopence, as a matter of fact, it did not come under my notice for a long
  time after it was made. May I further venture to point out that
  (reckoning postage) the expenditure of twopence-halfpenny, or, at the
  most, threepence, would have enabled Dr. Wace so far to comply with
  ordinary conventions, as to direct my attention to the fact that he had
  attacked me before a meeting at which I was not present? I really am not
  responsible for the five months' neglect of which Dr. Wace complains.
  Singularly enough, the Englishry who swarmed about the Engadine, during
  the three months that I was being brought back to life by the glorious
  air and perfect comfort of the Maloja, did not, in my hearing, say
  anything about the important events which had taken place at the Church
  Congress; and I think I can venture to affirm that there was not a single
  copy of Dr. Wace's pamphlet in any of the hotel libraries which I
  rummaged in search of something more edifying than dull English or
  questionable French novels.</p>

  <p>And now, having, as I hope, set myself right with the public as
  regards the sins of commission and <!-- Page 410 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page410"></a>{410}</span>omission with which I
  have been charged, I feel free to deal with matters to which time and
  type may be more profitably devoted.</p>

  <p>I believe that there is not a solitary argument I have used, or that I
  am about to use, which is original, or has anything to do with the fact
  that I have been chiefly occupied with natural science. They are all,
  facts and reasoning alike, either identical with, or consequential upon,
  propositions which are to be found in the works of scholars and
  theologians of the highest repute in the only two countries, Holland and
  Germany,<a name="NtA107" href="#Nt107"><sup>[107]</sup></a> in which, at
  the present time, professors of theology are to be found, whose tenure of
  their posts does not depend upon the results to which their inquiries
  lead them.<a name="NtA108" href="#Nt108"><sup>[108]</sup></a> It is true
  that, to the best of my ability, I have satisfied myself of the soundness
  of the foundations on which my arguments are built, and I desire to be
  held fully <!-- Page 411 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page411"></a>{411}</span>responsible for everything I say. But,
  nevertheless, my position is really no more than that of an expositor;
  and my justification for undertaking it is simply that conviction of the
  supremacy of private judgment (indeed, of the impossibility of escaping
  it) which is the foundation of the Protestant Reformation, and which was
  the doctrine accepted by the vast majority of the Anglicans of my youth,
  before that backsliding towards the "beggarly rudiments" of an effete and
  idolatrous sacerdotalism which has, even now, provided us with the
  saddest spectacle which has been offered to the eyes of Englishmen in
  this generation. A high court of ecclesiastical jurisdiction, with a host
  of great lawyers in battle array, is and, for Heaven knows how long, will
  be, occupied with these very questions of "washing of cups and pots and
  brazen vessels," which the Master, whose professed representatives are
  rending the Church over these squabbles, had in his mind when, as we are
  told, he uttered the scathing rebuke:&mdash;</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p>Well did Isaiah prophesy of you hypocrites, as it is written,</p>
      <p class="i6">This people honoureth me with their lips,</p>
      <p class="i6">But their heart is far from me.</p>
      <p class="i6">But in vain do they worship me,</p>

    </div>

    </div>
  </div>

  <p>Men who can be absorbed in bickerings over miserable disputes of this
  kind can have but little sympathy with the old evangelical doctrine of
  the "open Bible," or anything but a grave misgiving of the results of
  diligent reading of the Bible, without the <!-- Page 412 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page412"></a>{412}</span>help of ecclesiastical
  spectacles, by the mass of the people. Greatly to the surprise of many of
  my friends, I have always advocated the reading of the Bible, and the
  diffusion of the study of that most remarkable collection of books among
  the people. Its teachings are so infinitely superior to those of the
  sects, who are just as busy now as the Pharisees were eighteen hundred
  years ago, in smothering them under "the precepts of men"; it is so
  certain, to my mind, that the Bible contains within itself the refutation
  of nine-tenths of the mixture of sophistical metaphysics and old-world
  superstition which has been piled round it by the so-called Christians of
  later times; it is so clear that the only immediate and ready antidote to
  the poison which has been mixed with Christianity, to the intoxication
  and delusion of mankind, lies in copious draughts from the undefiled
  spring, that I exercise the right and duty of free judgment on the part
  of every man, mainly for the purpose of inducing other laymen to follow
  my example. If the New Testament is translated into Zulu by Protestant
  missionaries, it must be assumed that a Zulu convert is competent to draw
  from its contents all the truths which it is necessary for him to
  believe. I trust that I may, without immodesty, claim to be put on the
  same footing as the Zulu.</p>

  <p>The most constant reproach which is launched against persons of my way
  of thinking is that it is all very well for us to talk about the
  deductions of scientific thought, but what are the poor and the <!-- Page
  413 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page413"></a>{413}</span>uneducated
  to do? Has it ever occurred to those who talk in this fashion, that their
  creeds and the articles of their several confessions, their determination
  of the exact nature and extent of the teachings of Jesus, their
  expositions of the real meaning of that which is written in the Epistles
  (to leave aside all questions concerning the Old Testament), are nothing
  more than deductions which, at any rate, profess to be the result of
  strictly scientific thinking, and which are not worth attending to unless
  they really possess that character? If it is not historically true that
  such and such things happened in Palestine eighteen centuries ago, what
  becomes of Christianity? And what is historical truth but that of which
  the evidence bears strict scientific investigation? I do not call to mind
  any problem of natural science which has come under my notice which is
  more difficult, or more curiously interesting as a mere problem, than
  that of the origin of the Synoptic Gospels and that of the historical
  value of the narratives which they contain. The Christianity of the
  Churches stands or falls by the results of the purely scientific
  investigation of these questions. They were first taken up in a purely
  scientific spirit just about a century ago; they have been studied over
  and over again by men of vast knowledge and critical acumen; but he would
  be a rash man who should assert that any solution of these problems, as
  yet formulated, is exhaustive. The most that can be said is that certain
  prevalent solutions are certainly false, while others are more or less
  probably true. <!-- Page 414 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page414"></a>{414}</span></p>

  <p>If I am doing my best to rouse my countrymen out of their dogmatic
  slumbers, it is not that they may be amused by seeing who gets the best
  of it in a contest between a "scientist" and a theologian. The serious
  question is whether theological men of science, or theological special
  pleaders, are to have the confidence of the general public; it is the
  question whether a country in which it is possible for a body of
  excellent clerical and lay gentlemen to discuss, in public meeting
  assembled, how much it is desirable to let the congregations of the
  faithful know of the results of biblical criticism, is likely to wake up
  with anything short of the grasp of a rough lay hand upon its shoulder;
  it is the question whether the New Testament books, being, as I believe
  they were, written and compiled by people who, according to their lights,
  were perfectly sincere, will not, when properly studied as ordinary
  historical documents, afford us the means of self-criticism. And it must
  be remembered that the New Testament books are not responsible for the
  doctrine invented by the Churches that they are anything but ordinary
  historical documents. The author of the third gospel tells us, as
  straightforwardly as a man can, that he has no claim to any other
  character than that of an ordinary compiler and editor, who had before
  him the works of many and variously qualified predecessors.</p>

  <p>&nbsp;</p>

  <p>In my former papers, according to Dr. Wace, I have evaded giving an
  answer to his main proposition, which he states as follows&mdash; <!--
  Page 415 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page415"></a>{415}</span></p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>Apart from all disputed points of criticism, no one practically doubts
  that our Lord lived, and that He died on the cross, in the most intense
  sense of filial relation to His Father in Heaven, and that He bore
  testimony to that Father's providence, love, and grace towards mankind.
  The Lord's Prayer affords a sufficient evidence on these points. If the
  Sermon on the Mount alone be added, the whole unseen world, of which the
  Agnostic refuses to know anything, stands unveiled before us.... If Jesus
  Christ preached that Sermon, made those promises, and taught that prayer,
  then any one who says that we know nothing of God, or of a future life,
  or of an unseen world, says that he does not believe Jesus Christ (pp.
  354-355).</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>Again&mdash;</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>The main question at issue, in a word, is one which Professor Huxley
  has chosen to leave entirely on one side&mdash;whether, namely, allowing
  for the utmost uncertainty on other points of the criticism to which he
  appeals, there is any reasonable doubt that the Lord's Prayer and the
  Sermon on the Mount afford a true account of our Lord's essential belief
  and cardinal teaching (p. 355).</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>I certainly was not aware that I had evaded the questions here stated;
  indeed I should say that I have indicated my reply to them pretty
  clearly; but, as Dr. Wace wants a plainer answer, he shall certainly be
  gratified. If, as Dr. Wace declares it is, his "whole case is involved
  in" the argument as stated in the latter of these two extracts, so much
  the worse for his whole case. For I am of opinion that there is the
  gravest reason for doubting whether the "Sermon on the Mount" was ever
  preached, and whether the so-called "Lord's Prayer" was ever prayed, by
  Jesus of Nazareth. My reasons for this opinion are, among others,
  these:&mdash;There is now no doubt that the three Synoptic Gospels, so
  far from being the work of three <!-- Page 416 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page416"></a>{416}</span>independent writers,
  are closely interdependent,<a name="NtA109"
  href="#Nt109"><sup>[109]</sup></a> and that in one of two ways. Either
  all three contain, as their foundation, versions, to a large extent
  verbally identical, of one and the same tradition; or two of them are
  thus closely dependent on the third; and the opinion of the majority of
  the best critics has of late years more and more converged towards the
  conviction that our canonical second gospel (the so-called "Mark's"
  Gospel) is that which most closely represents the primitive groundwork of
  the three.<a name="NtA110" href="#Nt110"><sup>[110]</sup></a> That I take
  to be one of the most valid results of New Testament criticism, of
  immeasurably greater importance than the discussion about dates and
  authorship.</p>

  <p>But if, as I believe to be the case, beyond any rational doubt or
  dispute, the second gospel is the nearest extant representative of the
  oldest tradition, <!-- Page 417 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page417"></a>{417}</span>whether written or oral, how comes it that
  it contains neither the "Sermon on the Mount" nor the "Lord's Prayer,"
  those typical embodiments, according to Dr. Wace, of the "essential
  belief and cardinal teaching" of Jesus? Not only does "Mark's" gospel
  fail to contain the "Sermon on the Mount," or anything but a very few of
  the sayings contained in that collection; but, at the point of the
  history of Jesus where the "Sermon" occurs in "Matthew," there is in
  "Mark" an apparently unbroken narrative from the calling of James and
  John to the healing of Simon's wife's mother. Thus the oldest tradition
  not only ignores the "Sermon on the Mount," but, by implication, raises a
  probability against its being delivered when and where the later
  "Matthew" inserts it in his compilation.</p>

  <p>And still more weighty is the fact that the third gospel, the author
  of which tells us that he wrote after "many" others had "taken in hand"
  the same enterprise; who should therefore have known the first gospel (if
  it existed), and was bound to pay to it the deference due to the work of
  an apostolic eye-witness (if he had any reason for thinking it was
  so)&mdash;this writer, who exhibits far more literary competence than the
  other two, ignores any "Sermon on the Mount," such as that reported by
  "Matthew," just as much as the oldest authority does. Yet "Luke" has a
  great many passages identical, or parallel, with those in "Matthew's"
  "Sermon on the Mount," which are, for the most part, scattered about in a
  totally different connection. <!-- Page 418 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page418"></a>{418}</span></p>

  <p>Interposed, however, between the nomination of the Apostles and a
  visit to Capernaum; occupying, therefore, a place which answers to that
  of the "Sermon on the Mount" in the first gospel, there is, in the third
  gospel, a discourse which is as closely similar to the "Sermon on the
  Mount," in some particulars, as it is widely unlike it in others.</p>

  <p>This discourse is said to have been delivered in a "plain" or "level
  place" (Luke vi. 17), and by way of distinction we may call it the
  "Sermon on the Plain."</p>

  <p>I see no reason to doubt that the two Evangelists are dealing, to a
  considerable extent, with the same traditional material; and a comparison
  of the two "Sermons" suggests very strongly that "Luke's" version is the
  earlier. The correspondences between the two forbid the notion that they
  are independent. They both begin with a series of blessings, some of
  which are almost verbally identical. In the middle of each (Luke vi.
  27-38, Matt. v. 43-48) there is a striking exposition of the ethical
  spirit of the command given in Leviticus xix. 18. And each ends with a
  passage containing the declaration that a tree is to be known by its
  fruit, and the parable of the house built on the sand. But while there
  are only 29 verses in the "Sermon on the Plain" there are 107 in the
  "Sermon on the Mount;" the excess in length of the latter being chiefly
  due to the long interpolations, one of 30 verses before and one of 34
  verses after, the middlemost parallelism with Luke. Under these
  circumstances it is quite impossible to <!-- Page 419 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page419"></a>{419}</span>admit that there is
  more probability that "Matthew's" version of the Sermon is historically
  accurate than there is that Luke's version is so; and they cannot both be
  accurate.</p>

  <p>"Luke" either knew the collection of loosely-connected and aphoristic
  utterances which appear under the name of the "Sermon on the Mount" in
  "Matthew;" or he did not. If he did not, he must have been ignorant of
  the existence of such a document as our canonical "Matthew," a fact which
  does not make for the genuineness, or the authority, of that book. If he
  did, he has shown that he does not care for its authority on a matter of
  fact of no small importance; and that does not permit us to conceive that
  he believed the first gospel to be the work of an authority to whom he
  ought to defer, let alone that of an apostolic eye-witness.</p>

  <p>The tradition of the Church about the second gospel, which I believe
  to be quite worthless, but which is all the evidence there is for
  "Mark's" authorship, would have us believe that "Mark" was little more
  than the mouthpiece of the apostle Peter. Consequently, we are to suppose
  that Peter either did not know, or did not care very much for, that
  account of the "essential belief and cardinal teaching" of Jesus which is
  contained in the Sermon on the Mount; and, certainly, he could not have
  shared Dr. Wace's view of its importance.<a name="NtA111"
  href="#Nt111"><sup>[111]</sup></a></p>

<p><!-- Page 420 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page420"></a>{420}</span></p>

  <p>I thought that all fairly attentive and intelligent students of the
  gospels, to say nothing of theologians of reputation, knew these things.
  But how can any one who does know them have the conscience to ask whether
  there is "any reasonable doubt" that the Sermon on the Mount was preached
  by Jesus of Nazareth? If conjecture is permissible, where nothing else is
  possible, the most probable conjecture seems to be that "Matthew," having
  a <i>cento</i> of sayings attributed&mdash;rightly or wrongly it is
  impossible to say&mdash;to Jesus, among his materials, thought they were,
  or might be, records of a continuous discourse, and put them in at the
  place he thought likeliest. Ancient historians of the highest character
  saw no harm in composing long speeches which never were spoken, and
  putting them into the mouths of statesmen and warriors; and I presume
  that whoever is represented by "Matthew" would have been grievously
  astonished to find that any one objected to his following the example of
  the best models accessible to him.</p>

  <p>So with the "Lord's Prayer." Absent in our representative of the
  oldest tradition, it appears in both "Matthew" and "Luke." There is
  reason to believe that every pious Jew, at the commencement of our era,
  prayed three times a day, according to a formula which is embodied in the
  present <i>Schmone-Esre</i><a name="NtA112"
  href="#Nt112"><sup>[112]</sup></a> of <!-- Page 421 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page421"></a>{421}</span>the Jewish prayer-book.
  Jesus, who was assuredly, in all respects, a pious Jew, whatever else he
  may have been, doubtless did the same. Whether he modified the current
  formula, or whether the so-called "Lord's Prayer" is the prayer
  substituted for the <i>Schmone-Esre</i> in the congregations of the
  Gentiles, is a question which can hardly be answered.</p>

  <p>In a subsequent passage of Dr. Wace's article (p. 356) he adds to the
  list of the verities which he imagines to be unassailable, "The Story of
  the Passion." I am not quite sure what he means by this. I am not aware
  that any one (with the exception of certain ancient heretics) has
  propounded doubts as to the reality of the crucifixion; and certainly I
  have no inclination to argue about the precise accuracy of every detail
  of that pathetic story of suffering and wrong. But, if Dr. Wace means, as
  I suppose he does, that that which, according to the orthodox view,
  happened after the crucifixion, and which is, in a dogmatic sense, the
  most important part of the story, is founded on solid historical proofs,
  I must beg leave to express a diametrically opposite conviction.</p>

  <p>What do we find when the accounts of the events in question, contained
  in the three Synoptic gospels, are compared together? In the oldest,
  there is a simple, straightforward statement which, for anything that I
  have to urge to the contrary, may be exactly true. In the other two,
  there is, round this possible and probable nucleus, a mass of accretions
  of the most questionable character. <!-- Page 422 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page422"></a>{422}</span></p>

  <p>The cruelty of death by crucifixion depended very much upon its
  lingering character. If there were a support for the weight of the body,
  as not unfrequently was the practice, the pain during the first hours of
  the infliction was not, necessarily, extreme; nor need any serious
  physical symptoms, at once, arise from the wounds made by the nails in
  the hands and feet, supposing they were nailed, which was not invariably
  the case. When exhaustion set in, and hunger, thirst, and nervous
  irritation had done their work, the agony of the sufferer must have been
  terrible; and the more terrible that, in the absence of any effectual
  disturbance of the machinery of physical life, it might be prolonged for
  many hours, or even days. Temperate, strong men, such as were the
  ordinary Galilean peasants, might live for several days on the cross. It
  is necessary to bear these facts in mind when we read the account
  contained in the fifteenth chapter of the second gospel.</p>

  <p>Jesus was crucified at the third hour (xv. 25), and the narrative
  seems to imply that he died immediately after the ninth hour (<i>v.</i>
  34). In this case, he would have been crucified only six hours; and the
  time spent on the cross cannot have been much longer, because Joseph of
  Arimathæa must have gone to Pilate, made his preparations, and deposited
  the body in the rock-cut tomb before sunset, which, at that time of the
  year, was about the twelfth hour. That any one should die after only six
  hours' crucifixion could not have been at all in accordance with Pilate's
  large experience of the effects of that method of <!-- Page 423 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page423"></a>{423}</span>punishment. It,
  therefore, quite agrees with what might be expected if Pilate "marvelled
  if he were already dead" and required to be satisfied on this point by
  the testimony of the Roman officer who was in command of the execution
  party. Those who have paid attention to the extraordinarily difficult
  question, What are the indisputable signs of death?&mdash;will be able to
  estimate the value of the opinion of a rough soldier on such a subject;
  even if his report to the Procurator were in no wise affected by the fact
  that the friend of Jesus, who anxiously awaited his answer, was a man of
  influence and of wealth.</p>

  <p>The inanimate body, wrapped in linen, was deposited in a spacious,<a
  name="NtA113" href="#Nt113"><sup>[113]</sup></a> cool rock chamber, the
  entrance of which was closed, not by a well-fitting door, but by a stone
  rolled against the opening, which would of course allow free passage of
  air. A little more than thirty-six hours afterwards (Friday 6 <span
  class="scac">P.M.</span>, to Sunday 6 <span class="scac">A.M.</span>, or
  a little after) three women visit the tomb and find it empty. And they
  are told by a young man "arrayed in a white robe" that Jesus is gone to
  his native country of Galilee, and that the disciples and Peter will find
  him there.</p>

  <p>Thus it stands, plainly recorded, in the oldest tradition that, for
  any evidence to the contrary, the sepulchre may have been vacated at any
  time during the Friday or Saturday nights. If it is said that no Jew
  would have violated the Sabbath by taking the former course, it is to be
  recollected that Joseph of <!-- Page 424 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page424"></a>{424}</span>Arimathæa might well be familiar with that
  wise and liberal interpretation of the fourth commandment, which
  permitted works of mercy to men&mdash;nay even the drawing of an ox or an
  ass out of a pit&mdash;on the Sabbath. At any rate, the Saturday night
  was free to the most scrupulous of observers of the Law.</p>

  <p>These are the facts of the case as stated by the oldest extant
  narrative of them. I do not see why any one should have a word to say
  against the inherent probability of that narrative; and, for my part, I
  am quite ready to accept it as an historical fact, that so much and no
  more is positively known of the end of Jesus of Nazareth. On what grounds
  can a reasonable man be asked to believe any more? So far as the
  narrative in the first gospel, on the one hand, and those in the third
  gospel and the Acts, on the other, go beyond what is stated in the second
  gospel, they are hopelessly discrepant with one another. And this is the
  more significant because the pregnant phrase "some doubted," in the first
  gospel, is ignored in the third.</p>

  <p>But it is said that we have the witness Paul speaking to us directly
  in the Epistles. There is little doubt that we have, and a very singular
  witness he is. According to his own showing, Paul, in the vigour of his
  manhood, with every means of becoming acquainted, at first hand, with the
  evidence of eyewitnesses, not merely refused to credit them, but
  "persecuted the church of God and made havoc of it." The reasoning of
  Stephen fell dead upon the acute intellect of this zealot for the
  traditions of <!-- Page 425 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page425"></a>{425}</span>his fathers: his eyes were blind to the
  ecstatic illumination of the martyr's countenance "as it had been the
  face of an angel;" and when, at the words "Behold, I see the heavens
  opened and the Son of Man standing on the right hand of God," the
  murderous mob rushed upon and stoned the rapt disciple of Jesus, Paul
  ostentatiously made himself their official accomplice.</p>

  <p>Yet this strange man, because he has a vision one day, at once, and
  with equally headlong zeal, flies to the opposite pole of opinion. And he
  is most careful to tell us that he abstained from any re-examination of
  the facts.</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>Immediately I conferred not with flesh and blood; neither went I up to
  Jerusalem to them which were Apostles before me; but I went away into
  Arabia. (Galatians i. 16, 17.)</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>I do not presume to quarrel with Paul's procedure. If it satisfied
  him, that was his affair; and, if it satisfies any else, I am not called
  upon to dispute the right of that person to be satisfied. But I certainly
  have the right to say that it would not satisfy me, in like case; that I
  should be very much ashamed to pretend that it could, or ought to,
  satisfy me; and that I can entertain but a very low estimate of the value
  of the evidence of people who are to be satisfied in this fashion, when
  questions of objective fact, in which their faith is interested, are
  concerned. So that when I am called upon to believe a great deal more
  than the oldest gospel tells me about the final events of the history of
  Jesus on the authority of Paul (1 Corinthians xv. 5-8) I must pause. Did
  he think it, <!-- Page 426 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page426"></a>{426}</span>at any subsequent time, worth while "to
  confer with flesh and blood," or, in modern phrase, to re-examine the
  facts for himself? or was he ready to accept anything that fitted in with
  his preconceived ideas? Does he mean, when he speaks of all the
  appearances of Jesus after the crucifixion as if they were of the same
  kind, that they were all visions, like the manifestation to himself? And,
  finally, how is this account to be reconciled with those in the first and
  third gospels&mdash;which, as we have seen, disagree with one
  another?</p>

  <p>Until these questions are satisfactorily answered, I am afraid that,
  so far as I am concerned, Paul's testimony cannot be seriously regarded,
  except as it may afford evidence of the state of traditional opinion at
  the time at which he wrote, say between 55 and 60 <span
  class="scac">A.D.</span>; that is, more than twenty years after the
  event; a period much more than sufficient for the development of any
  amount of mythology about matters of which nothing was really known. A
  few years later, among the contemporaries and neighbours of the Jews,
  and, if the most probable interpretation of the Apocalypse can be
  trusted, among the followers of Jesus also, it was fully believed, in
  spite of all the evidence to the contrary, that the Emperor Nero was not
  really dead, but that he was hidden away somewhere in the East, and would
  speedily come again at the head of a great army, to be revenged upon his
  enemies.<a name="NtA114" href="#Nt114"><sup>[114]</sup></a></p>

  <p>Thus, I conceive that I have shown cause for the <!-- Page 427
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page427"></a>{427}</span>opinion that
  Dr. Wace's challenge touching the Sermon on the Mount, the Lord's Prayer,
  and the Passion was more valorous than discreet. After all this
  discussion, I am still at the agnostic point. Tell me, first, what Jesus
  can be proved to have been, said, and done, and I will say whether I
  believe him, or in him,<a name="NtA115"
  href="#Nt115"><sup>[115]</sup></a> or not. As Dr. Wace admits that I have
  dissipated his lingering shade of unbelief about the bedevilment of the
  Gadarene pigs, he might have done something to help mine. Instead of
  that, he manifests a total want of conception of the nature of the
  obstacles which impede the conversion of his "infidels."</p>

  <p>The truth I believe to be, that the difficulties in the way of
  arriving at a sure conclusion as to these matters, from the Sermon on the
  Mount, the Lord's Prayer, or any other data offered by the Synoptic
  gospels (and <i>à fortiori</i> from the fourth gospel), are insuperable.
  Every one of these records is coloured by the prepossessions of those
  among whom the primitive traditions arose, and of those by whom they were
  collected and edited; and the difficulty of making allowance for these
  prepossessions is enhanced by our ignorance of the exact dates at which
  the documents were first put together; of the extent to <!-- Page 428
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page428"></a>{428}</span>which they
  have been subsequently worked over and interpolated; and of the
  historical sense, or want of sense, and the dogmatic tendencies of their
  compilers and editors. Let us see if there is any other road which will
  take us into something better than negation.</p>

  <p>There is a widespread notion that the "primitive Church," while under
  the guidance of the Apostles and their immediate successors, was a sort
  of dogmatic dovecot, pervaded by the most loving unity and doctrinal
  harmony. Protestants, especially, are fond of attributing to themselves
  the merit of being nearer "the Church of the Apostles" than their
  neighbours; and they are the less to be excused for their strange
  delusion because they are great readers of the documents which prove the
  exact contrary. The fact is that, in the course of the first three
  centuries of its existence, the Church rapidly underwent a process of
  evolution of the most remarkable character, the final stage of which is
  far more different from the first than Anglicanism is from Quakerism. The
  key to the comprehension of the problem of the origin of that which is
  now called "Christianity," and its relation to Jesus of Nazareth, lies
  here. Nor can we arrive at any sound conclusion as to what it is probable
  that Jesus actually said and did without being clear on this head. By far
  the most important and subsequently influential steps in the evolution of
  Christianity took place in the course of the century, more or less, which
  followed upon the crucifixion. It is almost the darkest period of Church
  <!-- Page 429 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page429"></a>{429}</span>history, but, most fortunately, the
  beginning and the end of the period are brightly illuminated by the
  contemporary evidence of two writers of whose historical existence there
  is no doubt,<a name="NtA116" href="#Nt116"><sup>[116]</sup></a> and
  against the genuineness of whose most important works there is no
  widely-admitted objection. These are Justin, the philosopher and martyr,
  and Paul, the Apostle to the Gentiles. I shall call upon these witnesses
  only to testify to the condition of opinion among those who called
  themselves disciples of Jesus in their time.</p>

  <p>Justin, in his Dialogue with Trypho the Jew, which was written
  somewhere about the middle of the second century, enumerates certain
  categories of persons who, in his opinion, will, or will not, be saved.<a
  name="NtA117" href="#Nt117"><sup>[117]</sup></a> These are:&mdash;</p>

  <p>1. Orthodox Jews who refuse to believe that Jesus is the Christ.
  <i>Not saved.</i></p>

  <p>2. Jews who observe the Law; believe Jesus to be the Christ; but who
  insist on the observance of the Law by Gentile converts. <i>Not
  saved.</i></p>

  <p>3. Jews who observe the Law; believe Jesus to be the Christ, and hold
  that Gentile converts need not observe the Law. <i>Saved</i> (in Justin's
  opinion; but some of his fellow-Christians think the contrary).</p>

  <p>4. Gentile converts to the belief in Jesus as the Christ, who observe
  the Law. <i>Saved</i> (possibly).</p>

  <p>5. Gentile believers in Jesus as the Christ, who do <!-- Page 430
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page430"></a>{430}</span>not observe
  the Law themselves (except so far as the refusal of idol sacrifices), but
  do not consider those who do observe it heretics. <i>Saved</i> (this is
  Justin's own view).</p>

  <p>6. Gentile believers who do not observe the Law, except in refusing
  idol sacrifices, and hold those who do observe it to be heretics.
  <i>Saved.</i></p>

  <p>7. Gentiles who believe Jesus to be the Christ and call themselves
  Christians, but who eat meats sacrificed to idols. <i>Not saved.</i></p>

  <p>8. Gentiles who disbelieve in Jesus as the Christ. <i>Not
  saved.</i></p>

  <p>Justin does not consider Christians who believe in the natural birth
  of Jesus, of whom he implies that there is a respectable minority, to be
  heretics, though he himself strongly holds the preternatural birth of
  Jesus and his pre-existence as the "Logos" or "Word." He conceives the
  Logos to be a second God, inferior to the first, unknowable, God, with
  respect to whom Justin, like Philo, is a complete agnostic. The Holy
  Spirit is not regarded by Justin as a separate personality, and is often
  mixed up with the "Logos." The doctrine of the natural immortality of the
  soul is, for Justin, a heresy; and he is as firm a believer in the
  resurrection of the body, as in the speedy Second Coming and
  establishment of the millennium.</p>

  <p>This pillar of the Church in the middle of the second century&mdash;a
  much-travelled native of Samaria&mdash;was certainly well acquainted with
  Rome, probably with Alexandria, and it is likely that he knew <!-- Page
  431 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page431"></a>{431}</span>the state
  of opinion throughout the length and breadth of the Christian world as
  well as any man of his time. If the various categories above enumerated
  are arranged in a series thus:&mdash;</p>

</table>

  <p>it is obvious that they form a gradational series from orthodox
  Judaism, on the extreme left, to Paganism, whether philosophic or
  popular, on the extreme right; and it will further be observed that,
  while Justin's conception of Christianity is very broad, he rigorously
  excludes two classes of persons who, in his time, called themselves
  Christians; namely, those who insist on circumcision and other
  observances of the Law on the part of Gentile converts; that is to say,
  the strict Judæo-Christians (II.); and, on the other hand, those who
  assert the lawfulness of eating meat offered to idols&mdash;whether they
  are Gnostic or not (VII.) These last I have called "idolothytic"
  Christians, because I cannot devise a better name, not because it is
  strictly defensible etymologically.</p>

  <p>At the present moment, I do not suppose there is an English missionary
  in any heathen land who would trouble himself whether the materials of
  his dinner had been previously offered to idols or not. On the other
  hand, I suppose there is no Protestant sect within the pale of orthodoxy,
  to say nothing of the Roman and Greek Churches, which would hesitate to
  declare the practice of circumcision and the <!-- Page 432 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page432"></a>{432}</span>observance of the
  Jewish Sabbath and dietary rules, shockingly heretical.</p>

  <p>Modern Christianity has, in fact, not only shifted far to the right of
  Justin's position, but it is of much narrower compass.</p>

  <p>For, though it includes VII., and even, in saint and relic worship,
  cuts a "monstrous cantle" out of paganism, it excludes, not only all
  Judæo-Christians, but all who doubt that such are heretics. Ever since
  the thirteenth century, the Inquisition would have cheerfully burned, and
  in Spain did abundantly burn, all persons who came under the categories
  II., III., IV., V. And the wolf would play the same havoc now, if it
  could only get its blood-stained jaws free from the muzzle imposed by the
  secular arm.</p>

  <p>Further, there is not a Protestant body except the Unitarian, which
  would not declare Justin himself a heretic, on account of his doctrine of
  the inferior godship of the Logos; while I am very much afraid that, in
  strict logic, Dr. Wace would be under the necessity, so painful to him,
  of calling him an "infidel," on the same and on other grounds.</p>

  <p>Now let us turn to our other authority. If there is any result of
  critical investigations of the sources of Christianity which is
  certain,<a name="NtA118" href="#Nt118"><sup>[118]</sup></a> it is that
  Paul of <!-- Page 433 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page433"></a>{433}</span>Tarsus wrote the Epistle to the Galatians
  somewhere between the years 55 and 60 <span class="scac">A.D.</span>,
  that is to say, roughly, twenty, or five-and-twenty years after the
  crucifixion. If this is so, the Epistle to the Galatians is one of the
  oldest, if not the very oldest, of extant documentary evidences of the
  state of the primitive Church. And, be it observed, if it is Paul's
  writing, it unquestionably furnishes us with the evidence of a
  participator in the transactions narrated. With the exception of two or
  three of the other Pauline epistles, there is not one solitary book in
  the New Testament of the authorship and authority of which we have such
  good evidence.</p>

  <p>And what is the state of things we find disclosed? A bitter quarrel,
  in his account of which Paul by no means minces matters, or hesitates to
  hurl defiant sarcasms against those who were "reputed to be pillars:"
  James, "the brother of the Lord," Peter, the rock on whom Jesus is said
  to have built his Church, and John, "the beloved disciple." And no
  deference toward "the rock" withholds Paul from charging Peter to his
  face with "dissimulation."</p>

  <p>The subject of the hot dispute was simply this. Were Gentile converts
  bound to obey the Law or not? Paul answered in the negative; and, acting
  upon his opinion, had created at Antioch (and elsewhere) a specifically
  "Christian" community, the sole qualifications for admission into which
  were the confession of the belief that Jesus was the Messiah, and baptism
  upon that confession. In the epistle in question, Paul puts
  this&mdash;his "gospel," as he calls <!-- Page 434 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page434"></a>{434}</span>it&mdash;in its most
  extreme form. Not only does he deny the necessity of conformity with the
  Law, but he declares such conformity to have a negative value. "Behold,
  I, Paul, say unto you, that if ye receive circumcision, Christ will
  profit you nothing" (Galatians v. 2). He calls the legal observances
  "beggarly rudiments," and anathematises every one who preaches to the
  Galatians any other gospel than his own. That is to say, by direct
  consequence, he anathematises the Nazarenes of Jerusalem, whose zeal for
  the Law is testified by James in a passage of the Acts cited further on.
  In the first Epistle to the Corinthians, dealing with the question of
  eating meat offered to idols, it is clear that Paul himself thinks it a
  matter of indifference; but he advises that it should not be done, for
  the sake of the weaker brethren. On the other hand, the Nazarenes of
  Jerusalem most strenuously opposed Paul's "gospel," insisting on every
  convert becoming a regular Jewish proselyte, and consequently on his
  observance of the whole Law; and this party was led by James and Peter
  and John (Galatians ii. 9). Paul does not suggest that the question of
  principle was settled by the discussion referred to in Galatians. All he
  says is that it ended in the practical agreement that he and Barnabas
  should do as they had been doing, in respect to the Gentiles; while James
  and Peter and John should deal in their own fashion with Jewish converts.
  Afterwards, he complains bitterly of Peter, because, when on a visit to
  Antioch, he at first inclined to Paul's view, and ate with the Gentile
  converts; but when "certain came from James," <!-- Page 435 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page435"></a>{435}</span>"drew back, and
  separated himself, fearing them that were of the circumcision. And the
  rest of the Jews dissembled likewise with him; insomuch that even
  Barnabas was carried away with their dissimulation" (Galatians ii.
  12-13).</p>

  <p>There is but one conclusion to be drawn from Paul's account of this
  famous dispute, the settlement of which determined the fortunes of the
  nascent religion. It is that the disciples at Jerusalem, headed by
  "James, the Lord's brother," and by the leading apostles, Peter and John,
  were strict Jews, who had objected to admit any converts into their body,
  unless these, either by birth, or by becoming proselytes, were also
  strict Jews. In fact, the sole difference between James and Peter and
  John, with the body of the disciples whom they led, and the Jews by whom
  they were surrounded, and with whom they for many years shared the
  religious observances of the Temple, was that they believed that the
  Messiah, whom the leaders of the nation yet looked for, had already come
  in the person of Jesus of Nazareth.</p>

  <p>The Acts of the Apostles is hardly a very trustworthy history; it is
  certainly of later date than the Pauline Epistles, supposing them to be
  genuine. And the writer's version of the conference of which Paul gives
  so graphic a description, if that is correct, is unmistakably coloured
  with all the art of a reconciler, anxious to cover up a scandal. But it
  is none the less instructive on this account. The judgment of the
  "council" delivered by James is that the Gentile converts shall merely
  "abstain from things <!-- Page 436 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page436"></a>{436}</span>sacrificed to idols, and from blood and
  from things strangled, and from fornication." But notwithstanding the
  accommodation in which the writer of the Acts would have us believe, the
  Jerusalem Church held to its endeavour to retain the observance of the
  Law. Long after the conference, some time after the writing of the
  Epistles to the Galatians and Corinthians, and immediately after the
  despatch of that to the Romans, Paul makes his last visit to Jerusalem,
  and presents himself to James and all the elders. And this is what the
  Acts tells us of the interview:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>And they said unto him, Thou seest, brother, how many thousands [or
  myriads] there are among the Jews of them which have believed; and they
  are all zealous for the law; and they have been informed concerning thee,
  that thou teachest all the Jews which are among the Gentiles to forsake
  Moses, telling them not to circumcise their children, neither to walk
  after the customs. (Acts xxi. 20, 21.)</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>They therefore request that he should perform a certain public
  religious act in the Temple, in order that</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>all shall know that there is no truth in the things whereof they have
  been informed concerning thee; but that thou thyself walkest orderly,
  keeping the law (<i>ibid.</i> 24).<a name="NtA119"
  href="#Nt119"><sup>[119]</sup></a></p>

</blockquote>

  <p>How far Paul could do what he is here requested to do, and which the
  writer of the Acts goes on to say he did, with a clear conscience, if he
  wrote the Epistles to the Galatians and Corinthians, I may leave any
  candid reader of these epistles to decide. The <!-- Page 437 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page437"></a>{437}</span>point to which I wish
  to direct attention is the declaration that the Jerusalem Church, led by
  the brother of Jesus and by his personal disciples and friends, twenty
  years and more after his death, consisted of strict and zealous Jews.</p>

  <p>Tertullus, the orator, caring very little about the internal
  dissensions of the followers of Jesus, speaks of Paul as a "ringleader of
  the sect of the Nazarenes" (Acts xxiv. 5), which must have affected James
  much in the same way as it would have moved the Archbishop of Canterbury,
  in George Fox's day, to hear the latter called a "ringleader of the sect
  of Anglicans." In fact, "Nazarene" was, as is well known, the distinctive
  appellation applied to Jesus; his immediate followers were known as
  Nazarenes; while the congregation of the disciples, and, later, of
  converts at Jerusalem&mdash;the Jerusalem Church&mdash;was emphatically
  the "sect of the Nazarenes," no more in itself to be regarded as anything
  outside Judaism than the sect of the Sadducees or of the Essenes.<a
  name="NtA120" href="#Nt120"><sup>[120]</sup></a> In fact, the tenets of
  both the Sadducees and the Essenes diverged much more widely from the
  Pharisaic standard of orthodoxy than Nazarenism did.</p>

  <p>Let us consider the position of affairs now (<span
  class="scac">A.D.</span> 50-60) in relation to that which obtained in
  Justin's time, a century later. It is plain that the
  Nazarenes&mdash;presided over by James, "the brother of the Lord," and
  comprising within their body all the twelve <!-- Page 438 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page438"></a>{438}</span>apostles&mdash;belonged
  to Justin's second category of "Jews who observe the Law, believe Jesus
  to be the Christ, but who insist on the observance of the Law by Gentile
  converts," up till the time at which the controversy reported by Paul
  arose. They then, according to Paul, simply allowed him to form his
  congregations of non-legal Gentile converts at Antioch and elsewhere; and
  it would seem that it was to these converts, who would come under
  Justin's fifth category, that the title of "Christian" was first applied.
  If any of these Christians had acted upon the more than half-permission
  given by Paul, and had eaten meats offered to idols, they would have
  belonged to Justin's seventh category.</p>

  <p>Hence, it appears that, if Justin's opinion, which was probably that
  of the Church generally in the middle of the second century, was correct,
  James and Peter and John and their followers could not be saved; neither
  could Paul, if he carried into practice his views as to the indifference
  of eating meats offered to idols. Or, to put the matter another way, the
  centre of gravity of orthodoxy, which is at the extreme right of the
  series in the nineteenth century, was at the extreme left, just before
  the middle of the first century, when the "sect of the Nazarenes"
  constituted the whole church founded by Jesus and the apostles; while, in
  the time of Justin, it lay midway between the two. It is therefore a
  profound mistake to imagine that the Judæo-Christians (Nazarenes and
  Ebionites) of later times were heretical outgrowths from a primitive
  universalist "Christianity." On the <!-- Page 439 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page439"></a>{439}</span>contrary, the
  universalist "Christianity" is an outgrowth from the primitive, purely
  Jewish, Nazarenism; which, gradually eliminating all the ceremonial and
  dietary parts of the Jewish law, has thrust aside its parent, and all the
  intermediate stages of its development, into the position of damnable
  heresies.</p>

  <p>Such being the case, we are in a position to form a safe judgment of
  the limits within which the teaching of Jesus of Nazareth must have been
  confined. Ecclesiastical authority would have us believe that the words
  which are given at the end of the first Gospel, "Go ye, therefore, and
  make disciples of all the nations, baptizing them in the name of the
  Father and of the Son and of the Holy Ghost," are part of the last
  commands of Jesus, issued at the moment of his parting with the eleven.
  If so, Peter and John must have heard these words; they are too plain to
  be misunderstood; and the occasion is too solemn for them ever to be
  forgotten. Yet the "Acts" tell us that Peter needed a vision to enable
  him so much as to baptize Cornelius; and Paul, in the Galatians, knows
  nothing of words which would have completely borne him out as against
  those who, though they heard, must be supposed to have either forgotten
  or ignored them. On the other hand, Peter and John, who are supposed to
  have heard the "Sermon on the Mount," know nothing of the saying that
  Jesus had not come to destroy the Law, but that every jot and tittle of
  the Law must be fulfilled, which surely would have been pretty good
  evidence for their view of the question. <!-- Page 440 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page440"></a>{440}</span></p>

  <p>We are sometimes told that the personal friends and daily companions
  of Jesus remained zealous Jews and opposed Paul's innovations, because
  they were hard of heart and dull of comprehension. This hypothesis is
  hardly in accordance with the concomitant faith of those who adopt it, in
  the miraculous insight and superhuman sagacity of their Master; nor do I
  see any way of getting it to harmonise with the orthodox postulate;
  namely, that Matthew was the author of the first gospel and John of the
  fourth. If that is so, then, most assuredly, Matthew was no dullard; and
  as for the fourth gospel&mdash;a theosophic romance of the first
  order&mdash;it could have been written by none but a man of remarkable
  literary capacity, who had drunk deep of Alexandrian philosophy.
  Moreover, the doctrine of the writer of the fourth gospel is more remote
  from that of the "sect of the Nazarenes" than is that of Paul himself. I
  am quite aware that orthodox critics have been capable of maintaining
  that John, the Nazarene, who was probably well past fifty years of age
  when he is supposed to have written the most thoroughly Judaising book in
  the New Testament&mdash;the Apocalypse&mdash;in the roughest of Greek,
  underwent an astounding metamorphosis of both doctrine and style by the
  time he reached the ripe age of ninety or so, and provided the world with
  a history in which the acutest critic cannot [always] make out where the
  speeches of Jesus end and the text of the narrative begins; while that
  narrative is utterly irreconcilable, in regard to matters of fact, with
  that of his fellow-apostle, Matthew. <!-- Page 441 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page441"></a>{441}</span></p>

  <p>The end of the whole matter is this:&mdash;The "sect of the
  Nazarenes," the brother and the immediate followers of Jesus,
  commissioned by him as apostles, and those who were taught by them up to
  the year 50 <span class="scac">A.D.</span>, were not "Christians" in the
  sense in which that term has been understood ever since its asserted
  origin at Antioch, but Jews&mdash;strict orthodox Jews&mdash;whose belief
  in the Messiahship of Jesus never led to their exclusion from the Temple
  services, nor would have shut them out from the wide embrace of
  Judaism.<a name="NtA121" href="#Nt121"><sup>[121]</sup></a> The open
  proclamation of their special view about the Messiah was doubtless
  offensive to the Pharisees, just as rampant Low Churchism is offensive to
  bigoted High Churchism in our own country; or as any kind of dissent is
  offensive to fervid religionists of all creeds. To the Sadducees, no
  doubt, the political danger of any Messianic movement was serious; and
  they would have been glad to put down Nazarenism, lest it should end in
  useless rebellion against their Roman masters, like that other Galilean
  movement headed by Judas, a generation earlier. Galilee was always a
  hotbed of seditious enthusiasm against the rule of Rome; and high priest
  and procurator alike had need to keep a sharp eye upon natives of that
  district. On the whole, however, the Nazarenes were but little troubled
  for the first twenty years of their existence; and the undying hatred of
  the Jews against those later <!-- Page 442 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page442"></a>{442}</span>converts, whom they regarded as apostates
  and fautors of a sham Judaism, was awakened by Paul. From their point of
  view, he was a mere renegade Jew, opposed alike to orthodox Judaism and
  to orthodox Nazarenism, and whose teachings threatened Judaism with
  destruction. And, from their point of view, they were quite right. In the
  course of a century, Pauline influences had a large share in driving
  primitive Nazarenism from being the very heart of the new faith into the
  position of scouted error; and the spirit of Paul's doctrine continued
  its work of driving Christianity farther and farther away from Judaism,
  until "meats offered to idols" might be eaten without scruple, while the
  Nazarene methods of observing even the Sabbath, or the Passover, were
  branded with the mark of Judaising heresy.</p>

  <p>But if the primitive Nazarenes of whom the Acts speaks were orthodox
  Jews, what sort of probability can there be that Jesus was anything else?
  How can he have founded the universal religion which was not heard of
  till twenty years after his death?<a name="NtA122"
  href="#Nt122"><sup>[122]</sup></a> That Jesus possessed in a rare degree
  the gift of attaching men to his person and to his fortunes; that he was
  the author of many a striking saying, and the advocate of equity, of
  love, and of humility; that he may have disregarded the subtleties of the
  bigots for legal observance, and appealed rather to those noble <!-- Page
  443 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page443"></a>{443}</span>conceptions of religion which constituted
  the pith and kernel of the teaching of the great prophets of his nation
  seven hundred years earlier; and that, in the last scenes of his career,
  he may have embodied the ideal sufferer of Isaiah, may be, as I think it
  is, extremely probable. But all this involves not a step beyond the
  borders of orthodox Judaism. Again, who is to say whether Jesus
  proclaimed himself the veritable Messiah, expected by his nation since
  the appearance of the pseudo-prophetic work of Daniel, a century and a
  half before his time; or whether the enthusiasm of his followers
  gradually forced him to assume that position?</p>

  <p>But one thing is quite certain: if that belief in the speedy second
  coming of the Messiah which was shared by all parties in the primitive
  Church, whether Nazarene or Pauline; which Jesus is made to prophesy,
  over and over again, in the Synoptic gospels; and which dominated the
  life of Christians during the first century after the
  crucifixion;&mdash;if he believed and taught that, then assuredly he was
  under an illusion, and he is responsible for that which the mere
  effluxion of time has demonstrated to be a prodigious error.</p>

  <p>&nbsp;</p>

  <p>When I ventured to doubt "whether any Protestant theologian who has a
  reputation to lose will say that he believes the Gadarene story," it
  appears that I reckoned without Dr. Wace, who, referring to this passage
  in my paper, says:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>He will judge whether I fall under his description; but I repeat that
  I believe it, and that he has removed the only objection to my believing
  it (p. 363).</p>

</blockquote>

<p><!-- Page 444 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page444"></a>{444}</span></p>

  <p>Far be it from me to set myself up as a judge of any such delicate
  question as that put before me; but I think I may venture to express the
  conviction that, in the matter of courage, Dr. Wace has raised for
  himself a monument <i>ære perennius</i>. For really, in my poor judgment,
  a certain splendid intrepidity, such as one admires in the leader of a
  forlorn hope, is manifested by Dr. Wace when he solemnly affirms that he
  believes the Gadarene story on the evidence offered. I feel less
  complimented perhaps than I ought to do, when I am told that I have been
  an accomplice in extinguishing in Dr. Wace's mind the last glimmer of
  doubt which common sense may have suggested. In fact, I must disclaim all
  responsibility for the use to which the information I supplied has been
  put. I formally decline to admit that the expression of my ignorance
  whether devils, in the existence of which I do not believe, if they did
  exist, might or might not be made to go out of men into pigs, can, as a
  matter of logic, have been of any use whatever to a person who already
  believed in devils and in the historical accuracy of the gospels.</p>

  <p>Of the Gadarene story, Dr. Wace, with all solemnity and twice over,
  affirms that he "believes it." I am sorry to trouble him further, but
  what does he mean by "it"? Because there are two stories, one in "Mark"
  and "Luke," and the other in "Matthew." In the former, which I quoted in
  my previous paper, there is one possessed man; in the latter there are
  two. The story is told fully, with the vigorous homely diction and the
  <!-- Page 445 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page445"></a>{445}</span>picturesque details of a piece of
  folklore, in the second gospel. The immediately antecedent event is the
  storm on the Lake of Gennesaret. The immediately consequent events are
  the message from the ruler of the synagogue and the healing of the woman
  with an issue of blood. In the third gospel, the order of events is
  exactly the same, and there is an extremely close general and verbal
  correspondence between the narratives of the miracle. Both agree in
  stating that there was only one possessed man, and that he was the
  residence of many devils, whose name was "Legion."</p>

  <p>In the first gospel, the event which immediately precedes the Gadarene
  affair is, as before, the storm; the message from the ruler and the
  healing of the issue are separated from it by the accounts of the healing
  of a paralytic, of the calling of Matthew, and of a discussion with some
  Pharisees. Again, while the second gospel speaks of the country of the
  "Gerasenes" as the locality of the event, the third gospel has
  "Gerasenes," "Gergesenes," and "Gadarenes" in different ancient MSS.;
  while the first has "Gadarenes."</p>

  <p>The really important points to be noticed, however, in the narrative
  of the first gospel, are these&mdash;that there are two possessed men
  instead of one; and that while the story is abbreviated by omissions,
  what there is of it is often verbally identical with the corresponding
  passages in the other two gospels. The most unabashed of reconcilers
  cannot well say that one man is the same as two, or two as one; and, <!--
  Page 446 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page446"></a>{446}</span>though the suggestion really has been
  made, that two different miracles, agreeing in all essential particulars,
  except the number of the possessed, were effected immediately after the
  storm on the lake, I should be sorry to accuse any one of seriously
  adopting it. Nor will it be pretended that the allegory refuge is
  accessible in this particular case.</p>

  <p>So, when Dr. Wace says that he believes in the synoptic evangelists'
  account of the miraculous bedevilment of swine, I may fairly ask which of
  them does he believe? Does he hold by the one evangelist's story, or by
  that of the two evangelists? And having made his election, what reasons
  has he to give for his choice? If it is suggested that the witness of two
  is to be taken against that of one, not only is the testimony dealt with
  in that commonsense fashion against which the theologians of his school
  protest so warmly; not only is all question of inspiration at an end, but
  the further inquiry arises, After all, is it the testimony of two against
  one? Are the authors of the versions in the second and the third gospels
  really independent witnesses? In order to answer this question, it is
  only needful to place the English versions of the two side by side, and
  compare them carefully. It will then be seen that the coincidences
  between them, not merely in substance, but in arrangement, and in the use
  of identical words in the same order, are such, that only two
  alternatives are conceivable: either one evangelist freely copied from
  the other, or both based themselves upon a common source, which may
  either have been a written <!-- Page 447 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page447"></a>{447}</span>document, or a definite oral tradition
  learned by heart. Assuredly, these two testimonies are not those of
  independent witnesses. Further, when the narrative in the first gospel is
  compared with that in the other two, the same fact comes out.</p>

  <p>Supposing, then, that Dr. Wace is right in his assumption that
  Matthew, Mark, and Luke wrote the works which we find attributed to them
  by tradition, what is the value of their agreement, even that something
  more or less like this particular miracle occurred, since it is
  demonstrable, either that all depend on some antecedent statement, of the
  authorship of which nothing is known, or that two are dependent upon the
  third?</p>

  <p>Dr. Wace says he believes the Gadarene story; whichever version of it
  he accepts, therefore, he believes that Jesus said what he is stated in
  all the versions to have said, and thereby virtually declared that the
  theory of the nature of the spiritual world involved in the story is
  true. Now I hold that this theory is false, that it is a monstrous and
  mischievous fiction; and I unhesitatingly express my disbelief in any
  assertion that it is true, by whomsoever made. So that, if Dr. Wace is
  right in his belief, he is also quite right in classing me among the
  people he calls "infidels"; and although I cannot fulfil the eccentric
  expectation that I shall glory in a title which, from my point of view,
  it would be simply silly to adopt, I certainly shall rejoice not to be
  reckoned among "Christians" so long as the profession of belief in such
  stories as the Gadarene pig affair, on the <!-- Page 448 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page448"></a>{448}</span>strength of a tradition
  of unknown origin, of which two discrepant reports, also of unknown
  origin, alone remain, forms any part of the Christian faith. And,
  although I have, more than once, repudiated the gift of prophecy, yet I
  think I may venture to express the anticipation, that if "Christians"
  generally are going to follow the line taken by Dr. Wace, it will not be
  long before all men of common sense qualify for a place among the
  "infidels."</p>

<h3>XII</h3>

<h3>AGNOSTICISM AND CHRISTIANITY</h3>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>Nemo ergo ex me scire quærat, quod me nescire scio, nisi forte ut
  nescire discat.&mdash;<span class="sc">Augustinus</span>, <i>De Civ.
  Dei</i>, xii. 7.</p>

</blockquote>

  <p><a name="NtA123" href="#Nt123"><sup>[123]</sup></a>The present
  discussion has arisen out of the use, which has become general in the
  last few years, of the terms "Agnostic" and "Agnosticism."</p>

  <p>The people who call themselves "Agnostics" have been charged with
  doing so because they have not the courage to declare themselves
  "Infidels." It has been insinuated that they have adopted a new name in
  order to escape the unpleasantness which attaches to their proper
  denomination. To this wholly erroneous imputation, I have replied by
  showing that the term "Agnostic" did, as a matter of fact, arise in a
  manner which negatives it; and my statement has not been, and cannot be,
  refuted. Moreover, speaking for myself, and without impugning the right
  of any other person to use the term in another sense, I further say that
  Agnosticism <!-- Page 450 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page450"></a>{450}</span>is not properly described as a "negative"
  creed, nor indeed as a creed of any kind, except in so far as it
  expresses absolute faith in the validity of a principle, which is as much
  ethical as intellectual. This principle may be stated in various ways,
  but they all amount to this: that it is wrong for a man to say that he is
  certain of the objective truth of any proposition unless he can produce
  evidence which logically justifies that certainty. This is what
  Agnosticism asserts; and, in my opinion, it is all that is essential to
  Agnosticism. That which Agnostics deny and repudiate, as immoral, is the
  contrary doctrine, that there are propositions which men ought to
  believe, without logically satisfactory evidence; and that reprobation
  ought to attach to the profession of disbelief in such inadequately
  supported propositions. The justification of the Agnostic principle lies
  in the success which follows upon its application, whether in the field
  of natural, or in that of civil, history; and in the fact that, so far as
  these topics are concerned, no sane man thinks of denying its
  validity.</p>

  <p>Still speaking for myself, I add, that though Agnosticism is not, and
  cannot be, a creed, except in so far as its general principle is
  concerned; yet that the application of that principle results in the
  denial of, or the suspension of judgment concerning, a number of
  propositions respecting which our contemporary ecclesiastical "gnostics"
  profess entire certainty. And, in so far as these ecclesiastical persons
  can be justified in their old-established <!-- Page 451 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page451"></a>{451}</span>custom (which many
  nowadays think more honoured in the breach than the observance) of using
  opprobrious names to those who differ from them, I fully admit their
  right to call me and those who think with me "Infidels:" all I have
  ventured to urge is that they must not expect us to speak of ourselves by
  that title.</p>

  <p>The extent of the region of the uncertain, the number of the problems
  the investigation of which ends in a verdict of not proven, will vary
  according to the knowledge and the intellectual habits of the individual
  Agnostic. I do not very much care to speak of anything as "unknowable."
  What I am sure about is that there are many topics about which I know
  nothing; and which, so far as I can see, are out of reach of my
  faculties. But whether these things are knowable by any one else is
  exactly one of those matters which is beyond my knowledge, though I may
  have a tolerably strong opinion as to the probabilities of the case.
  Relatively to myself, I am quite sure that the region of
  uncertainty&mdash;the nebulous country in which words play the part of
  realities&mdash;is far more extensive than I could wish. Materialism and
  Idealism; Theism and Atheism; the doctrine of the soul and its mortality
  or immortality&mdash;appear in the history of philosophy like the shades
  of Scandinavian heroes, eternally slaying one another and eternally
  coming to life again in a metaphysical "Nifelheim." It is getting on for
  twenty-five centuries, at least, since mankind began seriously to give
  their minds to these topics. <!-- Page 452 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page452"></a>{452}</span>Generation after generation, philosophy
  has been doomed to roll the stone uphill; and, just as all the world
  swore it was at the top, down it has rolled to the bottom again. All this
  is written in innumerable books; and he who will toil through them will
  discover that the stone is just where it was when the work began. Hume
  saw this; Kant saw it; since their time, more and more eyes have been
  cleansed of the films which prevented them from seeing it; until now the
  weight and number of those who refuse to be the prey of verbal
  mystifications has begun to tell in practical life.</p>

  <p>It was inevitable that a conflict should arise between Agnosticism and
  Theology; or rather, I ought to say, between Agnosticism and
  Ecclesiasticism. For Theology, the science, is one thing; and
  Ecclesiasticism, the championship of a foregone conclusion<a
  name="NtA124" href="#Nt124"><sup>[124]</sup></a> as to the truth of a
  particular form of Theology, is another. With scientific Theology,
  Agnosticism has no quarrel. On the contrary, the Agnostic, knowing too
  well the influence of prejudice and idiosyncrasy, even on those who
  desire most earnestly to be impartial, can wish for nothing more urgently
  than that the scientific theologian should not only be at perfect liberty
  to thresh out the matter in his own fashion; but that he should, if he
  can, find flaws in the Agnostic position; and, even if demonstration is
  not to be had, that he should put, in their full force, the grounds of
  the conclusions he thinks probable. The <!-- Page 453 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page453"></a>{453}</span>scientific theologian
  admits the Agnostic principle, however widely his results may differ from
  those reached by the majority of Agnostics.</p>

  <p>But, as between Agnosticism and Ecclesiasticism, or, as our neighbours
  across the Channel call it, Clericalism, there can be neither peace nor
  truce. The Cleric asserts that it is morally wrong not to believe certain
  propositions, whatever the results of a strict scientific investigation
  of the evidence of these propositions. He tells us "that religious error
  is, in itself, of an immoral nature."<a name="NtA125"
  href="#Nt125"><sup>[125]</sup></a> He declares that he has prejudged
  certain conclusions, and looks upon those who show cause for arrest of
  judgment as emissaries of Satan. It necessarily follows that, for him,
  the attainment of faith, not the ascertainment of truth, is the highest
  aim of mental life. And, on careful analysis of the nature of this faith,
  it will too often be found to be, not the mystic process of unity with
  the Divine, understood by the religious enthusiast&mdash;but that which
  the candid simplicity of a Sunday scholar once defined it to be. "Faith,"
  said this unconscious plagiarist of Tertullian, "is the power of saying
  you believe things which are incredible."</p>

  <p>Now I, and many other Agnostics, believe that faith, in this sense, is
  an abomination; and though we do not indulge in the luxury of
  self-righteousness so far as to call those who are not of our way of
  thinking hard names, we do feel that the disagreement between ourselves
  and those who hold this <!-- Page 454 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page454"></a>{454}</span>doctrine is even more moral than
  intellectual. It is desirable there should be an end of any mistakes on
  this topic. If our clerical opponents were clearly aware of the real
  state of the case, there would be an end of the curious delusion, which
  often appears between the lines of their writings, that those whom they
  are so fond of calling "Infidels" are people who not only ought to be,
  but in their hearts are, ashamed of themselves. It would be discourteous
  to do more than hint the antipodal opposition of this pleasant dream of
  theirs to facts.</p>

  <p>The clerics and their lay allies commonly tell us, that if we refuse
  to admit that there is good ground for expressing definite convictions
  about certain topics, the bonds of human society will dissolve and
  mankind lapse into savagery. There are several answers to this assertion.
  One is that the bonds of human society were formed without the aid of
  their theology; and, in the opinion of not a few competent judges, have
  been weakened rather than strengthened by a good deal of it. Greek
  science, Greek art, the ethics of old Israel, the social organisation of
  old Rome, contrived to come into being without the help of any one who
  believed in a single distinctive article of the simplest of the Christian
  creeds. The science, the art, the jurisprudence, the chief political and
  social theories, of the modern world have grown out of those of Greece
  and Rome&mdash;not by favour of, but in the teeth of, the fundamental
  teachings of early Christianity, to which science, art, and any serious
  occupation with the things of this world, were alike despicable. <!--
  Page 455 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page455"></a>{455}</span></p>

  <p>Again, all that is best in the ethics of the modern world, in so far
  as it has not grown out of Greek thought, or Barbarian manhood, is the
  direct development of the ethics of old Israel. There is no code of
  legislation, ancient or modern, at once so just and so merciful, so
  tender to the weak and poor, as the Jewish law; and, if the Gospels are
  to be trusted, Jesus of Nazareth himself declared that he taught nothing
  but that which lay implicitly, or explicitly, in the religious and
  ethical system of his people.</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>And the scribe said unto him, Of a truth, Teacher, thou hast well said
  that He is one; and there is none other but He and to love Him with all
  the heart, and with all the understanding, and with all the strength, and
  to love his neighbour as himself, is much more than all whole burnt
  offerings and sacrifices. (Mark xii. 32, 33).</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>Here is the briefest of summaries of the teaching of the prophets of
  Israel of the eighth century; does the Teacher, whose doctrine is thus
  set forth in his presence, repudiate the exposition? Nay; we are told, on
  the contrary, that Jesus saw that he "answered discreetly," and replied,
  "Thou art not far from the Kingdom of God."</p>

  <p>So that I think that even if the creeds, from the so-called
  "Apostles'" to the so-called "Athanasian," were swept into oblivion; and
  even if the human race should arrive at the conclusion that, whether a
  bishop washes a cup or leaves it unwashed, is not a matter of the least
  consequence, it will get on very well. The causes which have led to the
  development of morality in mankind, which have guided or <!-- Page 456
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page456"></a>{456}</span>impelled us
  all the way from the savage to the civilised state, will not cease to
  operate because a number of ecclesiastical hypotheses turn out to be
  baseless. And, even if the absurd notion that morality is more the child
  of speculation than of practical necessity and inherited instinct, had
  any foundation; if all the world is going to thieve, murder, and
  otherwise misconduct itself as soon as it discovers that certain portions
  of ancient history are mythical; what is the relevance of such arguments
  to any one who holds by the Agnostic principle?</p>

  <p>Surely, the attempt to cast out Beelzebub by the aid of Beelzebub is a
  hopeful procedure as compared to that of preserving morality by the aid
  of immorality. For I suppose it is admitted that an Agnostic may be
  perfectly sincere, may be competent, and may have studied the question at
  issue with as much care as his clerical opponents. But, if the Agnostic
  really believes what he says, the "dreadful consequence" argufier
  (consistently, I admit, with his own principles) virtually asks him to
  abstain from telling the truth, or to say what he believes to be untrue,
  because of the supposed injurious consequences to morality. "Beloved
  brethren, that we may be spotlessly moral, before all things let us lie,"
  is the sum total of many an exhortation addressed to the "Infidel." Now,
  as I have already pointed out, we cannot oblige our exhorters. We leave
  the practical application of the convenient doctrines of "Reserve" and
  "Non-natural interpretation" to those who invented them. <!-- Page 457
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page457"></a>{457}</span></p>

  <p>I trust that I have now made amends for any ambiguity, or want of
  fulness, in my previous exposition of that which I hold to be the essence
  of the Agnostic doctrine. Henceforward, I might hope to hear no more of
  the assertion that we are necessarily Materialists, Idealists, Atheists,
  Theists, or any other <i>ists</i>, if experience had led me to think that
  the proved falsity of a statement was any guarantee against its
  repetition. And those who appreciate the nature of our position will see,
  at once, that when Ecclesiasticism declares that we ought to believe
  this, that, and the other, and are very wicked if we don't, it is
  impossible for us to give any answer but this: We have not the slightest
  objection to believe anything you like, if you will give us good grounds
  for belief; but, if you cannot, we must respectfully refuse, even if that
  refusal should wreck morality and insure our own damnation several times
  over. We are quite content to leave that to the decision of the future.
  The course of the past has impressed us with the firm conviction that no
  good ever comes of falsehood, and we feel warranted in refusing even to
  experiment in that direction.</p>

  <p>&nbsp;</p>

  <p>In the course of the present discussion it has been asserted that the
  "Sermon on the Mount" and the "Lord's Prayer" furnish a summary and
  condensed view of the essentials of the teaching of Jesus of Nazareth,
  set forth by himself. Now this supposed <i>Summa</i> of Nazarene theology
  distinctly affirms the existence of a spiritual world, of a Heaven, and
  of a <!-- Page 458 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page458"></a>{458}</span>Hell of fire; it teaches the Fatherhood of
  God and the malignity of the Devil; it declares the superintending
  providence of the former and our need of deliverance from the
  machinations of the latter; it affirms the fact of demoniac possession
  and the power of casting out devils by the faithful. And, from these
  premises, the conclusion is drawn, that those Agnostics who deny that
  there is any evidence of such a character as to justify certainty,
  respecting the existence and the nature of the spiritual world,
  contradict the express declarations of Jesus. I have replied to this
  argumentation by showing that there is strong reason to doubt the
  historical accuracy of the attribution to Jesus of either the "Sermon on
  the Mount" or the "Lord's Prayer"; and, therefore, that the conclusion in
  question is not warranted, at any rate on the grounds set forth.</p>

  <p>But, whether the Gospels contain trustworthy statements about this and
  other alleged historical facts or not, it is quite certain that from
  them, taken together with the other books of the New Testament, we may
  collect a pretty complete exposition of that theory of the spiritual
  world which was held by both Nazarenes and Christians; and which was
  undoubtedly supposed by them to be fully sanctioned by Jesus, though it
  is just as clear that they did not imagine it contained any revelation by
  him of something heretofore unknown. If the pneumatological doctrine
  which pervades the whole New Testament is nowhere systematically stated,
  it is everywhere assumed. The writers of <!-- Page 459 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page459"></a>{459}</span>the Gospels and of the
  Acts take it for granted, as a matter of common knowledge; and it is easy
  to gather from these sources a series of propositions, which only need
  arrangement to form a complete system.</p>

  <p>In this system, Man is considered to be a duality formed of a
  spiritual element, the soul; and a corporeal<a name="NtA126"
  href="#Nt126"><sup>[126]</sup></a> element, the body. And this duality is
  repeated in the Universe, which consists of a corporeal world embraced
  and interpenetrated by a spiritual world. The former consists of the
  earth, as its principal and central constituent, with the subsidiary sun,
  planets, and stars. Above the earth is the air, and below it the watery
  abyss. Whether the heaven, which is conceived to be above the air, and
  the hell in, or below, the subterranean deeps, are to be taken as
  corporeal or incorporeal is not clear. However this may be, the heaven
  and the air, the earth and the abyss, are peopled by innumerable beings
  analogous in nature to the spiritual element in man, and these spirits
  are of two kinds, good and bad. The chief of the good spirits, infinitely
  superior to all the others, and their creator, as well as the creator of
  the corporeal world and of the bad spirits, is God. His residence is
  heaven, where he is <!-- Page 460 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page460"></a>{460}</span>surrounded by the ordered hosts of good
  spirits; his angels, or messengers, and the executors of his will
  throughout the universe.</p>

  <p>On the other hand, the chief of the bad spirits is Satan, <i>the</i>
  devil <i>par excellence</i>. He and his company of demons are free to
  roam through all parts of the universe, except the heaven. These bad
  spirits are far superior to man in power and subtlety, and their whole
  energies are devoted to bringing physical and moral evils upon him, and
  to thwarting, so far as their power goes, the benevolent intentions of
  the Supreme Being. In fact, the souls and bodies of men form both the
  theatre and the prize of an incessant warfare between the good and the
  evil spirits&mdash;the powers of light and the powers of darkness. By
  leading Eve astray, Satan brought sin and death upon mankind. As the gods
  of the heathen, the demons are the founders and maintainers of idolatry;
  as the "powers of the air" they afflict mankind with pestilence and
  famine; as "unclean spirits" they cause disease of mind and body.</p>

  <p>The significance of the appearance of Jesus, in the capacity of the
  Messiah or Christ, is the reversal of the satanic work by putting an end
  to both sin and death. He announces that the kingdom of God is at hand,
  when the "Prince of this world" shall be finally "cast out" (John xii.
  31) from the cosmos, as Jesus, during his earthly career, cast him out
  from individuals. Then will Satan and all his devilry, along with the
  wicked whom they have seduced to their destruction, be hurled into the
  abyss of <!-- Page 461 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page461"></a>{461}</span>unquenchable fire&mdash;there to endure
  continual torture, without a hope of winning pardon from the merciful
  God, their Father; or of moving the glorified Messiah to one more act of
  pitiful intercession; or even of interrupting, by a momentary sympathy
  with their wretchedness, the harmonious psalmody of their brother angels
  and men, eternally lapped in bliss unspeakable.</p>

  <p>The straitest Protestant, who refuses to admit the existence of any
  source of Divine truth, except the Bible, will not deny that every point
  of the pneumatological theory here set forth has ample scriptural
  warranty. The Gospels, the Acts, the Epistles, and the Apocalypse assert
  the existence of the devil, of his demons and of Hell, as plainly as they
  do that of God and his angels and Heaven. It is plain that the Messianic
  and the Satanic conceptions of the writers of these books are the obverse
  and the reverse of the same intellectual coinage. If we turn from
  Scripture to the traditions of the Fathers and the confessions of the
  Churches, it will appear that, in this one particular, at any rate, time
  has brought about no important deviation from primitive belief. From
  Justin onwards, it may often be a fair question whether God, or the
  devil, occupies a larger share of the attention of the Fathers. It is the
  devil who instigates the Roman authorities to persecute; the gods and
  goddesses of paganism are devils, and idolatry itself is an invention of
  Satan; if a saint falls away from grace, it is by the seduction of the
  demon; if heresy arises, the devil has suggested it; <!-- Page 462
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page462"></a>{462}</span>and some of
  the Fathers<a name="NtA127" href="#Nt127"><sup>[127]</sup></a> go so far
  as to challenge the pagans to a sort of exorcising match, by way of
  testing the truth of Christianity. Mediæval Christianity is at one with
  patristic on this head. The masses, the clergy, the theologians, and the
  philosophers alike, live and move and have their being in a world full of
  demons, in which sorcery and possession are everyday occurrences. Nor did
  the Reformation make any difference. Whatever else Luther assailed, he
  left the traditional demonology untouched; nor could any one have
  entertained a more hearty and uncompromising belief in the devil, than he
  and, at a later period, the Calvinistic fanatics of New England did.
  Finally, in these last years of the nineteenth century, the demonological
  hypotheses of the first century are, explicitly or implicitly, held and
  occasionally acted upon by the immense majority of Christians of all
  confessions.</p>

  <p>Only here and there has the progress of scientific thought, outside
  the ecclesiastical world, so far affected Christians, that they and their
  teachers fight shy of the demonology of their creed. They are fain to
  conceal their real disbelief in one half of Christian doctrine by
  judicious silence about it; or by flight to those refuges for the
  logically destitute, accommodation or allegory. But the faithful who fly
  to allegory in order to escape absurdity resemble nothing so <!-- Page
  463 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page463"></a>{463}</span>much as
  the sheep in the fable who&mdash;to save their lives&mdash;jumped into
  the pit. The allegory pit is too commodious, is ready to swallow up so
  much more than one wants to put into it. If the story of the temptation
  is an allegory; if the early recognition of Jesus as the Son of God by
  the demons is an allegory; if the plain declaration of the writer of the
  first Epistle of John (iii. 8), "To this end was the Son of God
  manifested, that He might destroy the works of the devil," is
  allegorical, then the Pauline version of the Fall may be allegorical, and
  still more the words of consecration of the Eucharist, or the promise of
  the second coming; in fact, there is not a dogma of ecclesiastical
  Christianity the scriptural basis of which may not be whittled away by a
  similar process.</p>

  <p>As to accommodation, let any honest man who can read the New Testament
  ask himself whether Jesus and his immediate friends and disciples can be
  dishonoured more grossly than by the supposition that they said and did
  that which is attributed to them; while, in reality, they disbelieved in
  Satan and his demons, in possession and in exorcism?<a name="NtA128"
  href="#Nt128"><sup>[128]</sup></a></p>

  <p>An eminent theologian has justly observed that we have no right to
  look at the propositions of the Christian faith with one eye open and the
  other shut. (Tract 85, p. 29.) It really is not permissible to see, with
  one eye, that Jesus is affirmed to declare the personality and the
  Fatherhood of God, His loving providence and His accessibility to prayer;
  and to <!-- Page 464 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page464"></a>{464}</span>shut the other to the no less definite
  teaching ascribed to Jesus in regard to the personality and the
  misanthropy of the devil, his malignant watchfulness, and his subjection
  to exorcistic formulæ and rites. Jesus is made to say that the devil "was
  a murderer from the beginning" (John viii. 44) by the same authority as
  that upon which we depend for his asserted declaration that "God is a
  spirit" (John iv. 24).</p>

  <p>To those who admit the authority of the famous Vincentian dictum that
  the doctrine which has been held "always, everywhere, and by all" is to
  be received as authoritative, the demonology must possess a higher
  sanction than any other Christian dogma, except, perhaps, those of the
  Resurrection and of the Messiahship of Jesus; for it would be difficult
  to name any other points of doctrine on which the Nazarene does not
  differ from the Christian, and the different historical stages and
  contemporary subdivisions of Christianity from one another. And, if the
  demonology is accepted, there can be no reason for rejecting all those
  miracles in which demons play a part. The Gadarene story fits into the
  general scheme of Christianity; and the evidence for "Legion" and their
  doings is just as good as any other in the New Testament for the doctrine
  which the story illustrates.</p>

  <p>It was with the purpose of bringing this great fact into prominence;
  of getting people to open both their eyes when they look at
  Ecclesiasticism; that I devoted so much space to that miraculous story
  which happens to be one of the best types of its class. And <!-- Page 465
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page465"></a>{465}</span>I could not
  wish for a better justification of the course I have adopted, than the
  fact that my heroically consistent adversary has declared his implicit
  belief in the Gadarene story and (by necessary consequence) in the
  Christian demonology as a whole. It must be obvious, by this time, that,
  if the account of the spiritual world given in the New Testament,
  professedly on the authority of Jesus, is true, then the demonological
  half of that account must be just as true as the other half. And,
  therefore, those who question the demonology, or try to explain it away,
  deny the truth of what Jesus said, and are, in ecclesiastical
  terminology, "Infidels" just as much as those who deny the spirituality
  of God. This is as plain as anything can well be, and the dilemma for my
  opponent was either to assert that the Gadarene pig-bedevilment actually
  occurred, or to write himself down an "Infidel." As was to be expected,
  he chose the former alternative; and I may express my great satisfaction
  at finding that there is one spot of common ground on which both he and I
  stand. So far as I can judge, we are agreed to state one of the broad
  issues between the consequences of agnostic principles (as I draw them),
  and the consequences of ecclesiastical dogmatism (as he accepts it), as
  follows.</p>

  <p>Ecclesiasticism says: The demonology of the Gospels is an essential
  part of that account of that spiritual world, the truth of which it
  declares to be certified by Jesus.</p>

  <p>Agnosticism (<i>me judice</i>) says: There is no good <!-- Page 466
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page466"></a>{466}</span>evidence of
  the existence of a demonic spiritual world, and much reason for doubting
  it.</p>

  <p>Hereupon the ecclesiastic may observe: Your doubt means that you
  disbelieve Jesus; therefore you are an "Infidel" instead of an
  "Agnostic." To which the agnostic may reply: No; for two reasons: first,
  because your evidence that Jesus said what you say he said is worth very
  little; and secondly, because a man may be an agnostic, in the sense of
  admitting he has no positive knowledge, and yet consider that he has more
  or less probable ground for accepting any given hypothesis about the
  spiritual world. Just as a man may frankly declare that he has no means
  of knowing whether the planets generally are inhabited or not, and yet
  may think one of the two possible hypotheses more likely than the other,
  so he may admit that he has no means of knowing anything about the
  spiritual world, and yet may think one or other of the current views on
  the subject, to some extent, probable.</p>

  <p>The second answer is so obviously valid that it needs no discussion. I
  draw attention to it simply in justice to those agnostics who may attach
  greater value than I do to any sort of pneumatological speculations, and
  not because I wish to escape the responsibility of declaring that,
  whether Jesus sanctioned the demonological part of Christianity or not, I
  unhesitatingly reject it. The first answer, on the other hand, opens up
  the whole question of the claim of the biblical and other sources, from
  which hypotheses concerning the spiritual world are derived, to be <!--
  Page 467 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page467"></a>{467}</span>regarded as unimpeachable historical
  evidence as to matters of fact.</p>

  <p>Now, in respect of the trustworthiness of the Gospel narratives, I was
  anxious to get rid of the common assumption that the determination of the
  authorship and of the dates of these works is a matter of fundamental
  importance. That assumption is based upon the notion that what
  contemporary witnesses say must be true, or, at least, has always a
  <i>primâ facie</i> claim to be so regarded; so that if the writers of any
  of the Gospels were contemporaries of the events (and still more if they
  were in the position of eye-witnesses) the miracles they narrate must be
  historically true, and, consequently, the demonology which they involve
  must be accepted. But the story of the <i>Translation of the blessed
  martyrs Marcellinus and Petrus</i>, and the other considerations (to
  which endless additions might have been made from the Fathers and the
  mediæval writers) set forth in a preceding essay, yield, in my judgment,
  satisfactory proof that, where the miraculous is concerned, neither
  considerable intellectual ability, nor undoubted honesty, nor knowledge
  of the world, nor proved faithfulness as civil historians, nor profound
  piety, on the part of eye-witnesses and contemporaries, affords any
  guarantee of the objective truth of their statements, when we know that a
  firm belief in the miraculous was ingrained in their minds, and was the
  pre-supposition of their observations and reasonings.</p>

  <p>Therefore, although it be, as I believe, demonstrable that we have no
  real knowledge of the <!-- Page 468 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page468"></a>{468}</span>authorship, or of the date of composition
  of the Gospels, as they have come down to us, and that nothing better
  than more or less probable guesses can be arrived at on that subject, I
  have not cared to expend any space on the question. It will be admitted,
  I suppose, that the authors of the works attributed to Matthew, Mark,
  Luke, and John, whoever they may be, are personages whose capacity and
  judgment in the narration of ordinary events are not quite so well
  certified as those of Eginhard; and we have seen what the value of
  Eginhard's evidence is when the miraculous is in question.</p>

  <p>&nbsp;</p>

  <p>I have been careful to explain that the arguments which I have used in
  the course of this discussion are not new; that they are historical and
  have nothing to do with what is commonly called science; and that they
  are all, to the best of my belief, to be found in the works of
  theologians of repute.</p>

  <p>The position which I have taken up, that the evidence in favour of
  such miracles as those recorded by Eginhard, and consequently of mediæval
  demonology, is quite as good as that in favour of such miracles as the
  Gadarene, and consequently of Nazarene demonology, is none of my
  discovery. Its strength was, wittingly or unwittingly, suggested, a
  century and a half ago, by a theological scholar of eminence; and it has
  been, if not exactly occupied, yet so fortified with bastions and
  redoubts by a living ecclesiastical Vauban, that, in my judgment, it has
  been rendered impregnable. In the early part of <!-- Page 469 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page469"></a>{469}</span>the last century, the
  ecclesiastical mind in this country was much exercised by the question,
  not exactly of miracles, the occurrence of which in biblical times was
  axiomatic, but by the problem: When did miracles cease? Anglican divines
  were quite sure that no miracles had happened in their day, nor for some
  time past; they were equally sure that they happened sixteen or seventeen
  centuries earlier. And it was a vital question for them to determine at
  what point of time, between this <i>terminus a quo</i> and that
  <i>terminus ad quem</i>, miracles came to an end.</p>

  <p>The Anglicans and the Romanists agreed in the assumption that the
  possession of the gift of miracle-working was <i>primâ facie</i> evidence
  of the soundness of the faith of the miracle-workers. The supposition
  that miraculous powers might be wielded by heretics (though it might be
  supported by high authority) led to consequences too frightful to be
  entertained by people who were busied in building their dogmatic house on
  the sands of early Church history. If, as the Romanists maintained, an
  unbroken series of genuine miracles adorned the records of their Church,
  throughout the whole of its existence, no Anglican could lightly venture
  to accuse them of doctrinal corruption. Hence, the Anglicans, who
  indulged in such accusations, were bound to prove the modern, the
  mediæval Roman, and the later Patristic, miracles false; and to shut off
  the wonder-working power from the Church at the exact point of time when
  Anglican doctrine ceased and Roman doctrine <!-- Page 470 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page470"></a>{470}</span>began. With a little
  adjustment&mdash;a squeeze here and a pull there&mdash;the Christianity
  of the first three or four centuries might be made to fit, or seem to
  fit, pretty well into the Anglican scheme. So the miracles, from Justin
  say to Jerome, might be recognised; while, in later times, the Church
  having become "corrupt"&mdash;that is to say, having pursued one and the
  same line of development further than was pleasing to Anglicans&mdash;its
  alleged miracles must needs be shams and impostures.</p>

  <p>Under these circumstances, it may be imagined that the establishment
  of a scientific frontier between the earlier realm of supposed fact and
  the later of asserted delusion, had its difficulties; and torrents of
  theological special pleading about the subject flowed from clerical pens;
  until that learned and acute Anglican divine, Conyers Middleton, in his
  <i>Free Inquiry</i>, tore the sophistical web they had laboriously woven
  to pieces, and demonstrated that the miracles of the patristric age,
  early and late, must stand or fall together, inasmuch as the evidence for
  the later is just as good as the evidence for the earlier wonders. If the
  one set are certified by contemporaneous witnesses of high repute, so are
  the other; and, in point of probability, there is not a pin to choose
  between the two. That is the solid and irrefragable result of Middleton's
  contribution to the subject. But the Free Inquirer's freedom had its
  limits; and he draws a sharp line of demarcation between the patristic
  and the New Testament miracles&mdash;on the professed ground that the
  accounts of the <!-- Page 471 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page471"></a>{471}</span>latter, being inspired, are out of the
  reach of criticism.</p>

  <p>A century later, the question was taken up by another divine,
  Middleton's equal in learning and acuteness, and far his superior in
  subtlety and dialectic skill; who, though an Anglican, scorned the name
  of Protestant; and, while yet a Churchman, made it his business to
  parade, with infinite skill, the utter hollowness of the arguments of
  those of his brother Churchmen who dreamed that they could be both
  Anglicans and Protestants. The argument of the <i>Essay on the Miracles
  recorded in the Ecclesiastical History of the Early Ages</i>,<a
  name="NtA129" href="#Nt129"><sup>[129]</sup></a> by the present Roman
  Cardinal, but then Anglican Doctor, John Henry Newman, is compendiously
  stated by himself in the following passage:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>If the miracles of Church history cannot be defended by the arguments
  of Leslie, Lyttleton, Paley, or Douglas, how many of the Scripture
  miracles satisfy their conditions? (p. cvii).</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>And, although the answer is not given in so many words, little doubt
  is left on the mind of the reader, that, in the mind of the writer, it
  is: None. In fact, this conclusion is one which cannot be resisted, if
  the argument in favour of the Scripture miracles is based upon that which
  laymen, whether lawyers, or men of science, or historians, or ordinary
  men of affairs, call evidence. But there is something really impressive
  <!-- Page 472 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page472"></a>{472}</span>in the magnificent contempt with which, at
  times, Dr. Newman sweeps aside alike those who offer and those who demand
  such evidence.</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>Some infidel authors advise us to accept no miracles which would not
  have a verdict in their favour in a court of justice; that is, they
  employ against Scripture a weapon which Protestants would confine to
  attacks upon the Church; as if moral and religious questions required
  legal proof, and evidence were the test of truth<a name="NtA130"
  href="#Nt130"><sup>[130]</sup></a> (p. cvii).</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>"As if evidence were the test of truth"!&mdash;although the truth in
  question is the occurrence, or the non-occurrence of certain phenomena at
  a certain time and in a certain place. This sudden revelation of the
  great gulf fixed between the ecclesiastical and the scientific mind is
  enough to take away the breath of any one unfamiliar with the clerical
  organon. As if, one may retort, the assumption that miracles may, or
  have, served a moral or a religious end, in any way alters the fact that
  they profess to be historical events, things that actually happened; and,
  as such, must needs be exactly those subjects about which evidence is
  appropriate and legal proofs (which are such merely because they afford
  adequate evidence) may be justly demanded. The Gadarene miracle either
  happened, or it did not. Whether the Gadarene "question" is moral or
  religious, or not, has nothing to do with the fact that it is a purely
  <!-- Page 473 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page473"></a>{473}</span>historical question whether the demons
  said what they are declared to have said, and the devil-possessed pigs
  did, or did not, rush over the cliffs bounding the Lake of Gennesaret on
  a certain day of a certain year, after <span class="scac">A.D.</span> 26
  and before <span class="scac">A.D.</span> 36: for vague and uncertain as
  New Testament chronology is, I suppose it may be assumed that the event
  in question, if it happened at all, took place during the procuratorship
  of Pilate. If that is not a matter about which evidence ought to be
  required, and not only legal, but strict scientific proof demanded by
  sane men who are asked to believe the story&mdash;what is? Is a
  reasonable being to be seriously asked to credit statements, which, to
  put the case gently, are not exactly probable, and on the acceptance or
  rejection of which his whole view of life may depend, without asking for
  as much "legal" proof as would send an alleged pickpocket to gaol, or as
  would suffice to prove the validity of a disputed will?</p>

  <p>"Infidel authors" (if, as I am assured, I may answer for them) will
  decline to waste time on mere darkenings of counsel of this sort; but to
  those Anglicans who accept his premises, Dr. Newman is a truly formidable
  antagonist. What, indeed, are they to reply when he puts the very
  pertinent question:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>whether persons who not merely question, but prejudge the
  Ecclesiastical miracles on the ground of their want of resemblance,
  whatever that be, to those contained in Scripture&mdash;as if the
  Almighty could not do in the Christian Church what He had not already
  done at the time of its foundation, or under the Mosaic
  Covenant&mdash;whether such reasoners are not siding with the
  sceptic,</p>

</blockquote>

<p><!-- Page 474 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page474"></a>{474}</span></p>

  <p>and</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>whether it is not a happy inconsistency by which they continue to
  believe the Scriptures while they reject the Church<a name="NtA131"
  href="#Nt131"><sup>[131]</sup></a> (p. liii).</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>Again, I invite Anglican orthodoxy to consider this
  passage:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>the narrative of the combats of St. Antony with evil spirits, is a
  development rather than a contradiction of revelation, viz. of such texts
  as speak of Satan being cast out by prayer and fasting. To be shocked,
  then, at the miracles of Ecclesiastical history, or to ridicule them for
  their strangeness, is no part of a scriptural philosophy (pp.
  liii-liv).</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>Further on, Dr. Newman declares that it has been admitted</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>that a distinct line can be drawn in point of character and
  circumstance between the miracles of Scripture and of Church history; but
  this is by no means the case (p. lv) ... specimens are not wanting in the
  history of the Church, of miracles as awful in their character and as
  momentous in their effects as those which are recorded in Scripture. The
  fire interrupting the rebuilding of the Jewish temple, and the death of
  Arius, are instances, in Ecclesiastical history, of such solemn events.
  On the other hand, difficult instances in the Scripture history are such
  as these: the serpent in Eden, the Ark, Jacob's vision for the
  multiplication of his cattle, the speaking of Balaam's ass, the axe
  swimming at Elisha's word, the miracle on the swine, and various
  instances of prayers or prophecies, in which, as in that of Noah's
  blessing and curse, words which seem the result of private feeling are
  expressly or virtually ascribed to a Divine suggestion (p. lvi).</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>Who is to gainsay our ecclesiastical authority <!-- Page 475 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page475"></a>{475}</span>here? "Infidel authors"
  might be accused of a wish to ridicule the Scripture miracles by putting
  them on a level with the remarkable story about the fire which stopped
  the rebuilding of the Temple, or that about the death of Arius&mdash;but
  Dr. Newman is above suspicion. The pity is that his list of what he
  delicately terms "difficult" instances is so short. Why omit the
  manufacture of Eve out of Adam's rib, on the strict historical accuracy
  of which the chief argument of the defenders of an iniquitous portion of
  our present marriage law depends? Why leave out the account of the "Bene
  Elohim" and their gallantries, on which a large part of the worst
  practices of the mediæval inquisitors into witchcraft was based? Why
  forget the angel who wrestled with Jacob, and, as the account suggests,
  somewhat overstepped the bounds of fair play, at the end of the struggle?
  Surely, we must agree with Dr. Newman that, if all these camels have gone
  down, it savours of affectation to strain at such gnats as the sudden
  ailment of Arius in the midst of his deadly, if, prayerful,<a
  name="NtA132" href="#Nt132"><sup>[132]</sup></a> enemies; and the fiery
  explosion which <!-- Page 476 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page476"></a>{476}</span>stopped the Julian building operations.
  Though the <i>words</i> of the "Conclusion" of the <i>Essay on
  Miracles</i> may, perhaps, be quoted against me, I may express my
  satisfaction at finding myself in substantial accordance with a
  theologian above all suspicion of heterodoxy. With all my heart, I can
  declare my belief that there is just as good reason for believing in the
  miraculous slaying of the man who fell short of the Athanasian power of
  affirming contradictories, with respect to the nature of the Godhead, as
  there is for believing in the stories of the serpent and the ark told in
  Genesis, the speaking of Balaam's ass in Numbers, or the floating of the
  axe, at Elisha's order, in the second book of Kings.</p>

  <p>&nbsp;</p>

  <p>It is one of the peculiarities of a really sound argument that it is
  susceptible of the fullest development; and that it sometimes leads to
  conclusions unexpected by those who employ it. To my mind, it is
  impossible to refuse to follow Dr. Newman when he extends his reasoning
  from the miracles of the patristic and mediæval ages backward in time as
  far as miracles are recorded. But, if the rules of logic are valid, I
  feel compelled to extend the argument forward to the alleged Roman
  miracles of the present day, which Dr. Newman might not have admitted,
  but which Cardinal Newman may hardly reject. Beyond question, there is as
  good, or perhaps better, evidence for the miracles worked by our Lady of
  Lourdes, as there is for the floating of Elisha's axe, <!-- Page 477
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page477"></a>{477}</span>or the
  speaking of Balaam's ass. But we must go still further; there is a modern
  system of thaumaturgy and demonology which is just as well certified as
  the ancient.<a name="NtA133" href="#Nt133"><sup>[133]</sup></a>
  Veracious, excellent, sometimes learned and acute persons, even
  philosophers of no mean pretensions, testify to the "levitation" of
  bodies much heavier than Elisha's axe; to the existence of "spirits" who,
  to the mere tactile sense, have been indistinguishable from flesh and
  blood, and, occasionally, have wrestled with all the vigour of Jacob's
  opponent; yet, further, to the speech, in the language of raps, of
  spiritual beings, whose discourses, in point of coherence and value, are
  far inferior to that of Balaam's humble but sagacious steed. I have not
  the smallest doubt that, if these were persecuting times, there is many
  <!-- Page 478 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page478"></a>{478}</span>a worthy "spiritualist" who would
  cheerfully go to the stake in support of his pneumatological faith, and
  furnish evidence, after Paley's own heart, in proof of the truth of his
  doctrines. Not a few modern divines, doubtless struck by the
  impossibility of refusing the spiritualist evidence, if the
  ecclesiastical evidence is accepted, and deprived of any <i>à priori</i>
  objection by their implicit belief in Christian Demonology, show
  themselves ready to take poor Sludge seriously, and to believe that he is
  possessed by other devils than those of need, greed, and vainglory.</p>

  <p>Under these circumstances, it was to be expected, though it is none
  the less interesting to note the fact, that the arguments of the latest
  school of "spiritualists" present a wonderful family likeness to those
  which adorn the subtle disquisitions of the advocate of ecclesiastical
  miracles of forty years ago. It is unfortunate for the "spiritualists"
  that, over and over again, celebrated and trusted media, who really, in
  some respects, call to mind the Montanist<a name="NtA134"
  href="#Nt134"><sup>[134]</sup></a> and gnostic seers of the second
  century, are either proved in courts of law to be fraudulent impostors;
  <!-- Page 479 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page479"></a>{479}</span>or, in sheer weariness, as it would seem,
  of the honest dupes who swear by them, spontaneously confess their
  long-continued iniquities, as the Fox women did the other day in New
  York.<a name="NtA135" href="#Nt135"><sup>[135]</sup></a> But, whenever a
  catastrophe of this kind takes place, the believers are no wise dismayed
  by it. They freely admit that not only the media, but the spirits whom
  they summon, are sadly apt to lose sight of the elementary principles of
  right and wrong; and they triumphantly ask: How does the occurrence of
  occasional impostures disprove the genuine manifestations (that is to
  say, all those which have not yet been proved to be impostures or
  delusions)? And, in this, they unconsciously plagiarise from the
  churchman, who just as freely admits that many ecclesiastical miracles
  may have been forged; and asks, with calm contempt, not only of legal
  proofs, but of common-sense probability, Why does it follow that none are
  to be supposed genuine? I must say, however, that the spiritualists, so
  far as I know, do not venture to outrage right reason so boldly as the
  ecclesiastics. They do not sneer at "evidence"; nor repudiate the
  requirement of legal proofs. In fact, there can be no doubt that the
  spiritualists produce better evidence for their manifestations than can
  be shown either for the miraculous death of Arius, or for the Invention
  of the Cross.<a name="NtA136" href="#Nt136"><sup>[136]</sup></a></p>

<p><!-- Page 480 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page480"></a>{480}</span></p>

  <p>From the "levitation" of the axe at one end of a period of near three
  thousand years to the "levitation" of Sludge &amp; Co. at the other end,
  there is a complete continuity of the miraculous, with every gradation
  from the childish to the stupendous, from the gratification of a caprice
  to the illustration of sublime truth. There is no drawing a line in the
  series that might be set out of plausibly attested cases of spiritual
  intervention. If one is true, all may be true; if one is false, all may
  be false.</p>

  <p>&nbsp;</p>

  <p>This is, to my mind, the inevitable result of that method of reasoning
  which is applied to the confutation of Protestantism, with so much
  success, by one of the acutest and subtlest disputants who have ever
  championed Ecclesiasticism&mdash;and one cannot put his claims to
  acuteness and subtlety higher.</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>... the Christianity of history is not Protestantism. If ever there
  were a safe truth it is this.... "To be deep in history is to cease to be
  a Protestant."<a name="NtA137" href="#Nt137"><sup>[137]</sup></a></p>

</blockquote>

  <p>I have not a shadow of doubt that these anti-Protestant epigrams are
  profoundly true. But I have as little that, in the same sense, the
  "Christianity of history is not" Romanism; and that to be deeper in
  history is to cease to be a Romanist. The reasons which compel my doubts
  about the compatibility of the Roman doctrine, or any other form <!--
  Page 481 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page481"></a>{481}</span>of
  Catholicism, with history, arise out of exactly the same line of argument
  as that adopted by Dr. Newman in the famous essay which I have just
  cited. If, with one hand, Dr. Newman has destroyed Protestantism, he has
  annihilated Romanism with the other; and the total result of his
  ambidextral efforts is to shake Christianity to its foundations. Nor was
  any one better aware that this must be the inevitable result of his
  arguments&mdash;if the world should refuse to accept Roman doctrines and
  Roman miracles&mdash;than the writer of Tract 85.</p>

  <p>Dr. Newman made his choice and passed over to the Roman Church half a
  century ago. Some of those who were essentially in harmony with his views
  preceded, and many followed him. But many remained; and, as the quondam
  Puseyite and present Ritualistic party, they are continuing that work of
  sapping and mining the Protestantism of the Anglican Church which he and
  his friends so ably commenced. At the present time, they have no little
  claim to be considered victorious all along the line. I am old enough to
  recollect the small beginnings of the Tractarian party; and I am amazed
  when I consider the present position of their heirs. Their little leaven
  has leavened, if not the whole, yet a very large lump of the Anglican
  Church; which is now pretty much of a preparatory school for Papistry. So
  that it really behoves Englishmen (who, as I have been informed by high
  authority, are all, legally, members of the State Church, if they profess
  to belong to no other sect) to wake up to what that <!-- Page 482
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page482"></a>{482}</span>powerful
  organisation is about, and whither it is tending. On this point, the
  writings of Dr. Newman, while he still remained within the Anglican fold,
  are a vast store of the best and the most authoritative information. His
  doctrines on Ecclesiastical miracles and on Development are the
  corner-stones of the Tractarian fabric. He believed that his arguments
  led either Romeward, or to what ecclesiastics call "Infidelity," and I
  call Agnosticism. I believe that he was quite right in this conviction;
  but while he chooses the one alternative, I choose the other; as he
  rejects Protestantism on the ground of its incompatibility with history,
  so, <i>à fortiori</i>, I conceive that Romanism ought to be rejected, and
  that an impartial consideration of the evidence must refuse the authority
  of Jesus to anything more than the Nazarenism of James and Peter and
  John. And let it not be supposed that this is a mere "infidel" perversion
  of the facts. No one has more openly and clearly admitted the possibility
  that they may be fairly interpreted in this way than Dr. Newman. If, he
  says, there are texts which seem to show that Jesus contemplated the
  evangelisation of the heathen:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>... Did not the Apostles hear our Lord? and what was <i>their</i>
  impression from what they heard? Is it not certain that the Apostles did
  not gather this truth from His teaching? (Tract 85, p. 63).</p>

  <p>He said, "Preach the Gospel to every creature." These words
  <i>need</i> have only meant "Bring all men to Christianity through
  Judaism." Make them Jews, that they may enjoy Christ's privileges, which
  are lodged in Judaism; teach them those rites and ceremonies,
  circumcision and the like, which <!-- Page 483 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page483"></a>{483}</span>hitherto have been dead
  ordinances, and now are living: and so the Apostles seem to have
  understood them (<i>ibid.</i> p. 65).</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>So far as Nazarenism differentiated itself from contemporary orthodox
  Judaism, it seems to have tended towards a revival of the ethical and
  religious spirit of the prophetic age, accompanied by the belief in Jesus
  as the Messiah, and by various accretions which had grown round Judaism
  subsequently to the exile. To these belong the doctrines of the
  Resurrection, of the Last Judgment, of Heaven and Hell; of the hierarchy
  of good angels; of Satan and the hierarchy of evil spirits. And there is
  very strong ground for believing that all these doctrines, at least in
  the shapes in which they were held by the post-exilic Jews, were derived
  from Persian and Babylonian<a name="NtA138"
  href="#Nt138"><sup>[138]</sup></a> sources, and are essentially of
  heathen origin.</p>

  <p>How far Jesus positively sanctioned all these indrainings of
  circumjacent Paganism into Judaism; how far any one has a right to
  declare, that the refusal to accept one or other of these doctrines, as
  ascertained verities, comes to the same thing as contradicting Jesus, it
  appears to me not easy to say. But it is hardly less difficult to
  conceive that he could have distinctly negatived any of them; and, more
  especially, that demonology which has been accepted by <!-- Page 484
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page484"></a>{484}</span>the Christian
  Churches in every age and under all their mutual antagonisms. But, I
  repeat my conviction that, whether Jesus sanctioned the demonology of his
  time and nation or not, it is doomed. The future of Christianity, as a
  dogmatic system and apart from the old Israelitish ethics which it has
  appropriated and developed, lies in the answer which mankind will
  eventually give to the question whether they are prepared to believe such
  stories as the Gadarene and the pneumatological hypotheses which go with
  it, or not. My belief is they will decline to do anything of the sort,
  whenever and wherever their minds have been disciplined by science. And
  that discipline must, and will, at once follow and lead the footsteps of
  advancing civilisation.</p>

  <p>&nbsp;</p>

  <p>The preceding pages were written before I became acquainted with the
  contents of the May number of the <i>Nineteenth Century</i>, wherein I
  discover many things which are decidedly not to my advantage. It would
  appear that "evasion" is my chief resource, "incapacity for strict
  argument" and "rottenness of ratiocination" my main mental
  characteristics, and that it is "barely credible" that a statement which
  I profess to make of my own knowledge is true. All which things I notice,
  merely to illustrate the great truth, forced on me by long experience,
  that it is only from those who enjoy the blessing of a firm hold of the
  Christian faith that such manifestations of meekness, patience, and
  charity are to be expected. <!-- Page 485 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page485"></a>{485}</span></p>

  <p>I had imagined that no one who had read my preceding papers, could
  entertain a doubt as to my position in respect of the main issue as it
  has been stated and restated by my opponent:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>an Agnosticism which knows nothing of the relation of man to God must
  not only refuse belief to our Lord's most undoubted teaching, but must
  deny the reality of the spiritual convictions in which He lived.<a
  name="NtA139" href="#Nt139"><sup>[139]</sup></a></p>

</blockquote>

  <p>That is said to be "the simple question which is at issue between us,"
  and the three testimonies to that teaching and those convictions selected
  are the Sermon on the Mount, the Lord's Prayer, and the Story of the
  Passion.</p>

  <p>My answer, reduced to its briefest form, has been: In the first place,
  the evidence is such that the exact nature of the teachings and the
  convictions of Jesus is extremely uncertain, so that what ecclesiastics
  are pleased to call a denial of them may be nothing of the kind. And, in
  the second place, if Jesus taught the demonological system involved in
  the Gadarene story&mdash;if a belief in that system formed a part of the
  spiritual convictions in which he lived and died&mdash;then I, for my
  part, unhesitatingly refuse belief in that teaching, and deny the reality
  of those spiritual convictions. And I go further and add, that, exactly
  in so far as it can be proved that Jesus sanctioned the essentially pagan
  demonological theories current among the Jews of his age, exactly in so
  far, for me, will his authority in any matter touching the spiritual
  world be weakened.</p>

<p><!-- Page 486 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page486"></a>{486}</span></p>

  <p>With respect to the first half of my answer, I have pointed out that
  the Sermon on the Mount, as given in the first Gospel, is, in the opinion
  of the best critics, a "mosaic work" of materials derived from different
  sources, and I do not understand that this statement is challenged. The
  only other Gospel, the third, which contains something like it, makes,
  not only the discourse, but the circumstances under which it was
  delivered, very different. Now, it is one thing to say that there was
  something real at the bottom of the two discourses&mdash;which is quite
  possible; and another to affirm that we have any right to say what that
  something was, or to fix upon any particular phrase and declare it to be
  a genuine utterance. Those who pursue theology as a science, and bring to
  the study an adequate knowledge of the ways of ancient historians, will
  find no difficulty in providing illustrations of my meaning. I may supply
  one which has come within range of my own limited vision.</p>

  <p>In Josephus's <i>History of the Wars of the Jews</i> (chap, xix.),
  that writer reports a speech which he says Herod made at the opening of a
  war with the Arabians. It is in the first person, and would naturally be
  supposed by the reader to be intended for a true version of what Herod
  said. In the <i>Antiquities</i>, written some seventeen years later, the
  same writer gives another report, also in the first person, of Herod's
  speech on the same occasion. This second oration is twice as long as the
  first, and though the general tenour of the two speeches is <!-- Page 487
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page487"></a>{487}</span>pretty much
  the same, there is hardly any verbal identity, and a good deal of matter
  is introduced into the one, which is absent from the other. Josephus
  prides himself on his accuracy; people whose fathers might have heard
  Herod's oration were his contemporaries; and yet his historical sense is
  so curiously undeveloped that he can, quite innocently, perpetrate an
  obvious literary fabrication; for one of the two accounts must be
  incorrect. Now, if I am asked whether I believe that Herod made some
  particular statement on this occasion; whether, for example, he uttered
  the pious aphorism, "Where God is, there is both multitude and courage,"
  which is given in the <i>Antiquities</i>, but not in the <i>Wars</i>, I
  am compelled to say I do not know. One of the two reports must be
  erroneous, possibly both are: at any rate, I cannot tell how much of
  either is true. And, if some fervent admirer of the Idumean should build
  up a theory of Herod's piety upon Josephus's evidence that he propounded
  the aphorism, is it a "mere evasion" to say, in reply, that the evidence
  that he did utter it is worthless?</p>

  <p>It appears again that, adopting the tactics of Conachar when brought
  face to face with Hal o' the Wynd, I have been trying to get my
  simpleminded adversary to follow me on a wild-goose chase through the
  early history of Christianity, in the hope of escaping impending defeat
  on the main issue. But I may be permitted to point out that there is an
  alternative hypothesis which equally fits the facts; and that, after all,
  there <!-- Page 488 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page488"></a>{488}</span>may have been method in the madness of my
  supposed panic.</p>

  <p>For suppose it to be established that Gentile Christianity was a
  totally different thing from the Nazarenism of Jesus and his immediate
  disciples; suppose it to be demonstrable that, as early as the sixth
  decade of our era at least, there were violent divergencies of opinion
  among the followers of Jesus; suppose it to be hardly doubtful that the
  Gospels and the Acts took their present shapes under the influence of
  these divergencies; suppose that their authors, and those through whose
  hands they passed, had notions of historical veracity not more eccentric
  than those which Josephus occasionally displays: surely the chances that
  the Gospels are altogether trustworthy records of the teachings of Jesus
  become very slender. And since the whole of the case of the other side is
  based on the supposition that they are accurate records (especially of
  speeches, about which ancient historians are so curiously loose), I
  really do venture to submit that this part of my argument bears very
  seriously on the main issue; and, as ratiocination, is sound to the
  core.</p>

  <p>Again, when I passed by the topic of the speeches of Jesus on the
  Cross, it appears that I could have had no other motive than the dictates
  of my native evasiveness. An ecclesiastical dignitary may have
  respectable reasons for declining a fencing match "in sight of Gethsemane
  and Calvary"; but an ecclesiastical "Infidel"! Never. It is obviously
  impossible that, in the belief that "the greater includes the less," <!--
  Page 489 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page489"></a>{489}</span>I,
  having declared the Gospel evidence in general, as to the sayings of
  Jesus, to be of questionable value, thought it needless to select for
  illustration of my views, those particular instances which were likely to
  be most offensive to persons of another way of thinking. But any
  supposition that may have been entertained that the old familiar tones of
  the ecclesiastical war-drum will tempt me to engage in such needless
  discussion had better be renounced. I shall do nothing of the kind. Let
  it suffice that I ask my readers to turn to the twenty-third chapter of
  Luke (revised version), verse thirty-four, and he will find in the
  margin</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>Some ancient authorities omit: And Jesus said "Father forgive them,
  for they know not what they do."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>So that, even as late as the fourth century, there were ancient
  authorities, indeed some of the most ancient and weightiest, who either
  did not know of this utterance, so often quoted as characteristic of
  Jesus, or did not believe it had been uttered.</p>

  <p>Many years ago, I received an anonymous letter, which abused me
  heartily for my want of moral courage in not speaking out. I thought that
  one of the oddest charges an anonymous letter-writer could bring. But I
  am not sure that the plentiful sowing of the pages of the article with
  which I am dealing with accusations of evasion, may not seem odder to
  those who consider that the main strength of the answers with which I
  have been favoured (in this review and elsewhere) is devoted, not to
  anything in <!-- Page 490 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page490"></a>{490}</span>the text of my first paper, but to a note
  which occurs at p. 171. In this I say:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>Dr. Wace tells us: "It may be asked how far we can rely on the
  accounts we possess of our Lord's teaching on these subjects." And he
  seems to think the question appropriately answered by the assertion that
  it "ought to be regarded as settled by M. Renan's practical surrender of
  the adverse case."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>I requested Dr. Wace to point out the passages of M. Renan's works in
  which, as he affirms, this "practical surrender" (not merely as to the
  age and authorship of the Gospels, be it observed, but as to their
  historical value) is made, and he has been so good as to do so. Now let
  us consider the parts of Dr. Wace's citation from Renan which are
  relevant to the issue:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>The author of this Gospel [Luke] is certainly the same as the author
  of the Acts of the Apostles. Now the author of the Acts seems to be a
  companion of St. Paul&mdash;a character which accords completely with St.
  Luke. I know that more than one objection may be opposed to this
  reasoning; but one thing, at all events, is beyond doubt, namely, that
  the author of the third Gospel and of the Acts is a man who belonged to
  the second apostolic generation; and this suffices for our purpose.</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>This is a curious "practical surrender of the adverse case." M. Renan
  thinks that there is no doubt that the author of the third Gospel is the
  author of the Acts&mdash;a conclusion in which I suppose critics
  generally agree. He goes on to remark that this person <i>seems</i> to be
  a companion of St. Paul, and adds that Luke was a companion of St. Paul.
  Then, somewhat needlessly, M. Renan points out that there is more than
  one objection to jumping, from such data as these, to <!-- Page 491
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page491"></a>{491}</span>the conclusion
  that "Luke" is the writer of the third Gospel. And, finally, M. Renan is
  content to reduce that which is "beyond doubt" to the fact that the
  author of the two books is a man of the second apostolic generation.
  Well, it seems to me that I could agree with all that M. Renan considers
  "beyond doubt" here, without surrendering anything, either "practically"
  or theoretically.</p>

  <p>Dr. Wace (<i>Nineteenth Century</i>, March, p. 363) states that he
  derives the above citation from the preface to the 15th edition of the
  <i>Vie de Jésus</i>. My copy of <i>Les Évangiles</i>, dated 1877,
  contains a list of Renan's <i>&OElig;uvres Complètes</i>, at the head of
  which I find <i>Vie de Jésus</i>, 15<sup>e</sup> édition. It is,
  therefore, a later work than the edition of the <i>Vie de Jésus</i> which
  Dr. Wace quotes. Now <i>Les Évangiles</i>, as its name implies, treats
  fully of the questions respecting the date and authorship of the Gospels;
  and any one who desired, not merely to use M. Renan's expressions for
  controversial purposes, but to give a fair account of his views in their
  full significance, would, I think, refer to the later source.</p>

  <p>If this course had been taken, Dr. Wace might have found some as
  decided expressions of opinion in favour of Luke's authorship of the
  third Gospel as he has discovered in <i>The Apostles</i>. I mention this
  circumstance because I desire to point out that, taking even the
  strongest of Renan's statements, I am still at a loss to see how it
  justifies that large-sounding phrase, "practical surrender of the adverse
  case." For, on p. 438 of <i>Les Évangiles</i>, Renan speaks of the way in
  <!-- Page 492 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page492"></a>{492}</span>which Luke's "excellent intentions" have
  led him to torture history in the Acts; he declares Luke to be the
  founder of that "eternal fiction which is called ecclesiastical history";
  and, on the preceding page, he talks of the "myth" of the
  Ascension&mdash;with its "<i>mise en scène voulue</i>." At p. 435, I find
  "Luc, ou l'auteur quel qu'il soit du troisième Évangile"; at p. 280, the
  accounts of the Passion, the death and the resurrection of Jesus, are
  said to be "peu historiques"; at p. 283, "La valeur historique du
  troisième Évangile est sûrement moindre que celles des deux premiers." A
  Pyrrhic sort of victory for orthodoxy this "surrender!" And, all the
  while, the scientific student of theology knows that the more reason
  there may be to believe that Luke was the companion of Paul, the more
  doubtful becomes his credibility, if he really wrote the Acts. For, in
  that case, he could not fail to have been acquainted with Paul's account
  of the Jerusalem conference, and he must have consciously misrepresented
  it.</p>

  <p>We may next turn to the essential part of Dr. Wace's citation
  (<i>Nineteenth Century</i>, p. 365) touching the first Gospel:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>St. Matthew evidently deserves peculiar confidence for the discourses.
  Here are the "oracles"&mdash;the very notes taken while the memory of the
  instruction of Jesus was living and definite.</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>M. Renan here expresses the very general opinion as to the existence
  of a collection of "logia," having a different origin from the text in
  which they are embedded, in Matthew. "Notes" are somewhat suggestive of a
  shorthand writer, but the suggestion is <!-- Page 493 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page493"></a>{493}</span>unintentional, for M.
  Renan assumes that these "notes" were taken, not at the time of the
  delivery of the "logia" but subsequently, while (as he assumes) the
  memory of them was living and definite; so that, in this very citation,
  M. Renan leaves open the question of the general historical value of the
  first Gospel, while it is obvious that the accuracy of "notes" taken, not
  at the time of delivery, but from memory, is a matter about which more
  than one opinion may be fairly held. Moreover, Renan expressly calls
  attention to the difficulty of distinguishing the authentic "logia" from
  later additions of the same kind (<i>Les Évangiles</i>, p. 201). The fact
  is, there is no contradiction here to that opinion about the first Gospel
  which is expressed in <i>Les Évangiles</i> (p. 175).</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>The text of the so-called Matthew supposes the pre-existence of that
  of Mark, and does little more than complete it. He completes it in two
  fashions&mdash;first, by the insertion of those long discourses which
  gave their chief value to the Hebrew Gospels; then by adding traditions
  of a more modern formation, results of successive developments of the
  legend, and to which the Christian consciousness already attached
  infinite value.</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>M. Renan goes on to suggest that besides "Mark," "pseudo-Matthew" used
  an Aramaic version of the Gospel originally set forth in that dialect.
  Finally, as to the second Gospel (<i>Nineteenth Century</i>, p.
  365):&mdash;</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>He [Mark] is full of minute observations, proceeding, beyond doubt,
  from an eye-witness. There is nothing to conflict with the supposition
  that this eye-witness ... was the Apostle Peter himself, as Papias has
  it.</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>Let us consider this citation by the light of <i>Les
  Évangiles</i>:&mdash; <!-- Page 494 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page494"></a>{494}</span></p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>This work, although composed after the death of Peter, was, in a
  sense, the work of Peter; it represents the way in which Peter was
  accustomed to relate the life of Jesus (p. 116).</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>M. Renan goes on to say that, as an historical document, the Gospel of
  Mark has a great superiority (p. 116); but Mark has a motive for omitting
  the discourses, and he attaches a "puerile importance" to miracles (p.
  117). The Gospel of Mark is less a legend than a biography written with
  credulity (p. 118). It would be rash to say that Mark has not been
  interpolated and retouched (p. 120).</p>

  <p>If any one thinks that I have not been warranted in drawing a sharp
  distinction between "scientific theologians" and "counsels for creeds";
  or that my warning against the too ready acceptance of certain
  declarations as to the state of biblical criticism was needless; or that
  my anxiety as to the sense of the word "practical" was superfluous; let
  him compare the statement that M. Renan has made a "practical surrender
  of the adverse case" with the facts just set forth. For what is the
  adverse case? The question, as Dr. Wace puts it, is, "It may be asked how
  far can we rely on the accounts we possess of our Lord's teaching on
  these subjects." It will be obvious that M. Renan's statements amount to
  an adverse answer&mdash;to a "practical" denial that any great reliance
  can be placed on these accounts. He does not believe that Matthew, the
  apostle, wrote the first Gospel; he does not profess to know who is
  responsible for the collection of "logia," or how many of them are
  authentic; though he calls the second Gospel the <!-- Page 495 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page495"></a>{495}</span>most historical, he
  points out that it is written with credulity, and may have been
  interpolated and retouched; and, as to the author, "quel qu'il soit," of
  the third Gospel, who is to "rely on the accounts" of a writer who
  deserves the cavalier treatment which "Luke" meets with at M. Renan's
  hands?</p>

  <p>I repeat what I have already more than once said, that the question of
  the age and the authorship of the Gospels has not, in my judgment, the
  importance which is so commonly assigned to it; for the simple reason
  that the reports, even of eye-witnesses, would not suffice to justify
  belief in a large and essential part of their contents; on the contrary,
  these reports would discredit the witnesses. The Gadarene miracle, for
  example, is so extremely improbable, that the fact of its being reported
  by three, even independent, authorities could not justify belief in it
  unless we had the clearest evidence as to their capacity as observers and
  as interpreters of their observations. But it is evident that the three
  authorities are not independent; that they have simply adopted a legend,
  of which there were two versions; and instead of their proving its truth,
  it suggests their superstitious credulity: so that if "Matthew," "Mark,"
  and "Luke" are really responsible for the Gospels, it is not the better
  for the Gadarene story, but the worse for them.</p>

  <p>A wonderful amount of controversial capital has been made out of my
  assertion in the note to which I have referred, as an <i>obiter
  dictum</i> of no consequence <!-- Page 496 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page496"></a>{496}</span>to my argument, that if Renan's work<a
  name="NtA140" href="#Nt140"><sup>[140]</sup></a> were non-extant, the
  main results of biblical criticism, as set forth in the works of Strauss,
  Baur, Reuss, and Volkmar, for example, would not be sensibly affected. I
  thought I had explained it satisfactorily already, but it seems that my
  explanation has only exhibited still more of my native perversity, so I
  ask for one more chance.</p>

  <p>In the course of the historical development of any branch of science,
  what is universally observed is this: that the men who make epochs, and
  are the real architects of the fabric of exact knowledge, are those who
  introduce fruitful ideas or methods. As a rule, the man who does this
  pushes his idea, or his method, too far; or, if he does not, his school
  is sure to do so, and those who follow have to reduce his work to its
  proper value, and assign it its place in the whole. Not unfrequently
  they, in their turn, overdo the critical process, and, in trying to
  eliminate error, throw away truth.</p>

  <p>Thus, as I said, Linnæus, Buffon, Cuvier, Lamarck, really "set forth
  the results" of a developing science, although they often heartily
  contradict one another. Notwithstanding this circumstance, modern
  classificatory method and nomenclature have largely grown out of the work
  of Linnæus; the modern conception of biology, as a science, and of its
  relation to climatology, geography, and geology, are as largely rooted in
  the results of the labours of Buffon; comparative <!-- Page 497 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page497"></a>{497}</span>anatomy and
  palæontology owe a vast debt to Cuvier's results; while invertebrate
  zoology and the revival of the idea of evolution are intimately dependent
  on the results of the work of Lamarck. In other words, the main results
  of biology up to the early years of this century are to be found in, or
  spring out of, the works of these men.</p>

  <p>So, if I mistake not, Strauss, if he did not originate the idea of
  taking the mythop&oelig;ic faculty into account in the development of the
  Gospel narratives, and though he may have exaggerated the influence of
  that faculty, obliged scientific theology hereafter to take that element
  into serious consideration; so Baur, in giving prominence to the cardinal
  fact of the divergence of the Nazarene and Pauline tendencies in the
  primitive Church; so Reuss, in setting a marvellous example of the cool
  and dispassionate application of the principles of scientific criticism
  over the whole field of Scripture; so Volkmar, in his clear and forcible
  statement of the Nazarene limitations of Jesus, contributed results of
  permanent value in scientific theology. I took these names as they
  occurred to me. Undoubtedly, I might have advantageously added to them;
  perhaps I might have made a better selection. But it really is absurd to
  try to make out that I did not know that these writers widely disagree;
  and I believe that no scientific theologian will deny that, in principle,
  what I have said is perfectly correct. Ecclesiastical advocates, of
  course, cannot be expected to take this view of the matter. To them,
  these mere seekers after truth, in so far as <!-- Page 498 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page498"></a>{498}</span>their results are
  unfavourable to the creed the clerics have to support, are more or less
  "infidels," or favourers of "infidelity"; and the only thing they care to
  see, or probably can see, is the fact that, in a great many matters, the
  truth-seekers differ from one another, and therefore can easily be
  exhibited to the public, as if they did nothing else; as if any one who
  referred to their having, each and all, contributed his share to the
  results of theological science, was merely showing his ignorance; and as
  if a charge of inconsistency could be based on the fact that he himself
  often disagrees with what they say. I have never lent a shadow of
  foundation to the assumption that I am a follower of either Strauss, or
  Baur, or Reuss, or Volkmar, or Renan; my debt to these eminent
  men&mdash;so far my superiors in theological knowledge&mdash;is, indeed,
  great; yet it is not for their opinions, but for those I have been able
  to form for myself, by their help.</p>

  <p>In <i>Agnosticism: a Rejoinder</i> (p. <a href="#page410">410</a>), I
  have referred to the difficulties under which those professors of the
  science of theology, whose tenure of their posts depends on the results
  of their investigations, must labour; and, in a note, I add&mdash;</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>Imagine that all our chairs of Astronomy had been founded in the
  fourteenth century, and that their incumbents were bound to sign
  Ptolemaic articles. In that case, with every respect for the efforts of
  persons thus hampered to attain and expound the truth, I think men of
  common sense would go elsewhere to learn astronomy.</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>I did not write this paragraph without a <!-- Page 499 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page499"></a>{499}</span>knowledge that its
  sense would be open to the kind of perversion which it has suffered; but,
  if that was clear, the necessity for the statement was still clearer. It
  is my deliberate opinion: I reiterate it; and I say that, in my judgment,
  it is extremely inexpedient that any subject which calls itself a science
  should be entrusted to teachers who are debarred from freely following
  out scientific methods to their legitimate conclusions, whatever those
  conclusions may be. If I may borrow a phrase paraded at the Church
  Congress, I think it "ought to be unpleasant" for any man of science to
  find himself in the position of such a teacher.</p>

  <p>Human nature is not altered by seating it in a professorial chair,
  even of theology. I have very little doubt that if, in the year 1859, the
  tenure of my office had depended upon my adherence to the doctrines of
  Cuvier, the objections to those set forth in the <i>Origin of Species</i>
  would have had a halo of gravity about them that, being free to teach
  what I pleased, I failed to discover. And, in making that statement, it
  does not appear to me that I am confessing that I should have been
  debarred by "selfish interests" from making candid inquiry, or that I
  should have been biassed by "sordid motives." I hope that even such a
  fragment of moral sense as may remain in an ecclesiastical "infidel"
  might have got me through the difficulty; but it would be unworthy to
  deny or disguise the fact that a very serious difficulty must have been
  created for me by the nature of my tenure. And let it be observed that
  <!-- Page 500 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page500"></a>{500}</span>the temptation, in my case, would have
  been far slighter than in that of a professor of theology; whatever
  biological doctrine I had repudiated, nobody I cared for would have
  thought the worse of me for so doing. No scientific journals would have
  howled me down, as the religious newspapers howled down my too honest
  friend, the late Bishop of Natal; nor would my colleagues of the Royal
  Society have turned their backs upon me, as his episcopal colleagues
  boycotted him.</p>

  <p>I say these facts are obvious, and that it is wholesome and needful
  that they should be stated. It is in the interests of theology, if it be
  a science, and it is in the interests of those teachers of theology who
  desire to be something better than counsel for creeds, that it should be
  taken to heart. The seeker after theological truth and that only, will no
  more suppose that I have insulted him, than the prisoner who works in
  fetters will try to pick a quarrel with me, if I suggest that he would
  get on better if the fetters were knocked off; unless indeed, as it is
  said does happen in the course of long captivities, that the victim at
  length ceases to feel the weight of his chains, or even takes to hugging
  them, as if they were honourable ornaments.<a name="NtA141"

<h3>XIII</h3>

<h3>THE LIGHTS OF THE CHURCH AND THE
LIGHT OF SCIENCE</h3>

  <p>There are three ways of regarding any account of past occurrences,
  whether delivered to us orally or recorded in writing.</p>

  <p>The narrative may be exactly true. That is to say, the words, taken in
  their natural sense, and interpreted according to the rules of grammar,
  may convey to the mind of the hearer, or of the reader, an idea precisely
  correspondent with one which would have remained in the mind of a
  witness. For example, the statement that King Charles the First was
  beheaded at Whitehall on the 30th day of January 1649, is as exactly true
  as any proposition in mathematics or physics; no one doubts that any
  person of sound faculties, properly placed, who was present at Whitehall
  throughout that day, and who used his eyes, would have seen the King's
  head cut off; and that there would have remained in his mind an idea of
  that occurrence which he would have put into words of the same value as
  those which we use to express it. <!-- Page 502 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page502"></a>{502}</span></p>

  <p>Or the narrative may be partly true and partly false. Thus, some
  histories of the time tell us what the King said, and what Bishop Juxon
  said; or report royalist conspiracies to effect a rescue; or detail the
  motives which induced the chiefs of the Commonwealth to resolve that the
  King should die. One account declares that the King knelt at a high
  block, another that he lay down with his neck on a mere plank. And there
  are contemporary pictorial representations of both these modes of
  procedure. Such narratives, while veracious as to the main event, may and
  do exhibit various degrees of unconscious and conscious
  misrepresentation, suppression, and invention, till they become hardly
  distinguishable from pure fictions. Thus, they present a transition to
  narratives of a third class, in which the fictitious element
  predominates. Here, again, there are all imaginable gradations, from such
  works as Defoe's quasi-historical account of the Plague year, which
  probably gives a truer conception of that dreadful time than any
  authentic history, through the historical novel, drama, and epic, to the
  purely phantasmal creations of imaginative genius, such as the old
  <i>Arabian Nights</i>, or the modern <i>Shaving of Shagpat</i>. It is not
  strictly needful for my present purpose that I should say anything about
  narratives which are professedly fictitious. Yet it may be well, perhaps,
  if I disclaim any intention of derogating from their value, when I insist
  upon the paramount necessity of recollecting that there is no sort of
  relation between the ethical, or the æsthetic, or even <!-- Page 503
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page503"></a>{503}</span>the scientific
  importance of such works, and their worth as historical documents.
  Unquestionably, to the poetic artist, or even to the student of
  psychology, <i>Hamlet</i> and <i>Macbeth</i> may be better instructors
  than all the books of a wilderness of professors of æsthetics or of moral
  philosophy. But, as evidence of occurrences in Denmark, or in Scotland,
  at the times and places indicated, they are out of court; the profoundest
  admiration for them, the deepest gratitude for their influence, are
  consistent with the knowledge that, historically speaking, they are
  worthless fables, in which any foundation of reality that may exist is
  submerged beneath the imaginative superstructure.</p>

  <p>At present, however, I am not concerned to dwell upon the importance
  of fictitious literature and the immensity of the work which it has
  effected in the education of the human race. I propose to deal with the
  much more limited inquiry: Are there two other classes of consecutive
  narratives (as distinct from statements of individual facts), or only
  one? Is there any known historical work which is throughout exactly true,
  or is there not? In the case of the great majority of histories the
  answer is not doubtful: they are all only partially true. Even those
  venerable works which bear the names of some of the greatest of ancient
  Greek and Roman writers, and which have been accepted by generation after
  generation, down to modern times, as stores of unquestionable truth, have
  been compelled by scientific criticism, after a long battle, to descend
  to the common level, and to confess to a large admixture of error. I
  might <!-- Page 504 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page504"></a>{504}</span>fairly take this for granted; but it may
  be well that I should entrench myself behind the very apposite words of a
  historical authority who is certainly not obnoxious to even a suspicion
  of sceptical tendencies.</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>Time was&mdash;and that not very long ago&mdash;when all the relations
  of ancient authors concerning the old world were received with a ready
  belief; and an unreasoning and uncritical faith accepted with equal
  satisfaction the narrative of the campaigns of Cæsar and of the doings of
  Romulus, the account of Alexander's marches and of the conquests of
  Semiramis. We can most of us remember when, in this country, the whole
  story of regal Rome, and even the legend of the Trojan settlement in
  Latium, were seriously placed before boys as history, and discoursed of
  as unhesitatingly and in as dogmatic a tone as the tale of the Catiline
  Conspiracy or the Conquest of Britain....</p>

  <p>But all this is now changed. The last century has seen the birth and
  growth of a new science&mdash;the Science of Historical Criticism.... The
  whole world of profane history has been revolutionised....<a
  name="NtA142" href="#Nt142"><sup>[142]</sup></a></p>

</blockquote>

  <p>If these utterances were true when they fell from the lips of a
  Bampton lecturer in 1859, with how much greater force do they appeal to
  us now, when the immense labours of the generation now passing away
  constitute one vast illustration of the power and fruitfulness of
  scientific methods of investigation in history, no less than in all other
  departments of knowledge.</p>

  <p>At the present time, I suppose, there is no one who doubts that
  histories which appertain to any <!-- Page 505 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page505"></a>{505}</span>other people than the
  Jews, and their spiritual progeny in the first century, fall within the
  second class of the three enumerated. Like Goethe's Autobiography, they
  might all be entitled "Wahrheit und Dichtung"&mdash;"Truth and Fiction."
  The proportion of the two constituents changes indefinitely; and the
  quality of the fiction varies through the whole gamut of unveracity. But
  "Dichtung" is always there. For the most acute and learned of historians
  cannot remedy the imperfections of his sources of information; nor can
  the most impartial wholly escape the influence of the "personal equation"
  generated by his temperament and by his education. Therefore, from the
  narratives of Herodotus to those set forth in yesterday's <i>Times</i>,
  all history is to be read subject to the warning that fiction has its
  share therein. The modern vast development of fugitive literature cannot
  be the unmitigated evil that some do vainly say it is, since it has put
  an end to the popular delusion of less press-ridden times, that what
  appears in print must be true. We should rather hope that some beneficent
  influence may create among the erudite a like healthy suspicion of
  manuscripts and inscriptions, however ancient; for a bulletin may lie,
  even though it be written in cuneiform characters. Hotspur's starling,
  that was to be taught to speak nothing but "Mortimer" into the ears of
  King Henry the Fourth, might be a useful inmate of every historian's
  library, if "Fiction" were substituted for the name of Harry Percy's
  friend. <!-- Page 506 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page506"></a>{506}</span></p>

  <p>But it was the chief object of the lecturer to the congregation
  gathered in St. Mary's, Oxford, thirty-one years ago, to prove to them,
  by evidence gathered with no little labour and marshalled with much
  skill, that one group of historical works was exempt from the general
  rule; and that the narratives contained in the canonical Scriptures are
  free from any admixture of error. With justice and candour, the lecturer
  impresses upon his hearers that the special distinction of Christianity,
  among the religions of the world, lies in its claim to be historical; to
  be surely founded upon events which have happened, exactly as they are
  declared to have happened in its sacred books; which are true, that is,
  in the sense that the statement about the execution of Charles the First
  is true. Further, it is affirmed that the New Testament presupposes the
  historical exactness of the Old Testament; that the points of contact of
  "sacred" and "profane" history are innumerable; and that the
  demonstration of the falsity of the Hebrew records, especially in regard
  to those narratives which are assumed to be true in the New Testament,
  would be fatal to Christian theology.</p>

  <p>My utmost ingenuity does not enable me to discover a flaw in the
  argument thus briefly summarised. I am fairly at a loss to comprehend how
  any one, for a moment, can doubt that Christian theology must stand or
  fall with the historical trustworthiness of the Jewish Scriptures. The
  very conception of the Messiah, or Christ, is inextricably interwoven
  with Jewish history; the identification <!-- Page 507 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page507"></a>{507}</span>of Jesus of Nazareth
  with that Messiah rests upon the interpretation of passages of the Hebrew
  Scriptures which have no evidential value unless they possess the
  historical character assigned to them. If the covenant with Abraham was
  not made; if circumcision and sacrifices were not ordained by Jahveh; if
  the "ten words" were not written by God's hand on the stone tables; if
  Abraham is more or less a mythical hero, such as Theseus; the story of
  the Deluge a fiction; that of the Fall a legend; and that of the Creation
  the dream of a seer; if all these definite and detailed narratives of
  apparently real events have no more value as history than have the
  stories of the regal period of Rome&mdash;what is to be said about the
  Messianic doctrine, which is so much less clearly enunciated? And what
  about the authority of the writers of the books of the New Testament,
  who, on this theory, have not merely accepted flimsy fictions for solid
  truths, but have built the very foundations of Christian dogma upon
  legendary quicksands?</p>

  <p>But these may be said to be merely the carpings of that carnal reason
  which the profane call common sense; I hasten, therefore, to bring up the
  forces of unimpeachable ecclesiastical authority in support of my
  position. In a sermon preached last December, in St. Paul's Cathedral,<a
  name="NtA143" href="#Nt143"><sup>[143]</sup></a> Canon Liddon
  declares:&mdash;</p>

<p><!-- Page 508 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page508"></a>{508}</span></p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>For Christians it will be enough to know that our Lord Jesus Christ
  set the seal of His infallible sanction on the whole of the Old
  Testament. He found the Hebrew Canon as we have it in our hands to-day,
  and he treated it as an authority which was above discussion. Nay more:
  He went out of His way&mdash;if we may reverently speak thus&mdash;to
  sanction not a few portions of it which modern scepticism rejects. When
  he would warn His hearers against the dangers of spiritual relapse, He
  bids them remember "Lot's wife."<a name="NtA144"
  href="#Nt144"><sup>[144]</sup></a> When He would point out how worldly
  engagements may blind the soul to a coming judgment, He reminds them how

  all.<a name="NtA145" href="#Nt145"><sup>[145]</sup></a> If He would put

</blockquote>

  <p>The preacher proceeds to brush aside the common&mdash;I had almost
  said vulgar&mdash;apologetic pretext that Jesus was using <i>ad
  hominem</i> arguments, or "accommodating" his better knowledge to popular
  ignorance, as well as to point out the inadmissibility of the other
  alternative, that he shared the popular ignorance. And to those who hold
  the latter view sarcasm is dealt out with no niggard hand.</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>But they will find it difficult to persuade mankind that, if He could
  be mistaken on a matter of such strictly religious importance as the
  value of the sacred literature of His countrymen, He can be safely
  trusted about anything else. The trustworthiness of the Old Testament is,
  in fact, inseparable from the trustworthiness of our Lord Jesus Christ;
  and if we believe that He is the true Light of the world, we shall close
  our ears against suggestions impairing the credit of those Jewish
  Scriptures which have received the stamp of His Divine authority (p.
  25).</p>

</blockquote>

<p><!-- Page 509 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page509"></a>{509}</span></p>

  <p>Moreover, I learn from the public journals that a brilliant and
  sharply-cut view of orthodoxy, of like hue and pattern, was only the
  other day exhibited in that great theological kaleidoscope, the pulpit of
  St. Mary's, recalling the time so long past by, when a Bampton lecturer,
  in the same place, performed the unusual feat of leaving the faith of
  old-fashioned Christians undisturbed.</p>

  <p>Yet many things have happened in the intervening thirty-one years. The
  Bampton lecturer of 1859 had to grapple only with the infant Hercules of
  historical criticism; and he is now a full-grown athlete, bearing on his
  shoulders the spoils of all the lions that have stood in his path. Surely
  a martyr's courage, as well as a martyr's faith, is needed by any one
  who, at this time, is prepared to stand by the following plea for the
  veracity of the Pentateuch:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>Adam, according to the Hebrew original, was for 243 years contemporary
  with Methuselah, who conversed for a hundred years with Shem. Shem was
  for fifty years contemporary with Jacob, who probably saw Jochebed,
  Moses's mother. Thus, Moses might by oral tradition have obtained the
  history of Abraham, and even of the Deluge, at third hand; and that of
  the Temptation and the Fall at fifth hand....</p>

  <p>If it be granted&mdash;as it seems to be&mdash;that the great and
  stirring events in a nation's life will, under ordinary circumstances, be
  remembered (apart from all written memorials) for the space of 150 years,
  being handed down through five generations, it must be allowed (even on
  mere human grounds) that the account which Moses gives of the Temptation
  and the Fall is to be depended upon, if it passed through no more than
  four hands between him and Adam.<a name="NtA147"
  href="#Nt147"><sup>[147]</sup></a></p>

</blockquote>

<p><!-- Page 510 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page510"></a>{510}</span></p>

  <p>If "the trustworthiness of our Lord Jesus Christ" is to stand or fall
  with the belief in the sudden transmutation of the chemical components of
  a woman's body into sodium chloride, or on the "admitted reality" of
  Jonah's ejection, safe and sound, on the shores of the Levant, after
  three day's sea-journey in the stomach of a gigantic marine animal, what
  possible pretext can there be for even hinting a doubt as to the precise
  truth of the longevity attributed to the Patriarchs? Who that has
  swallowed the camel of Jonah's journey will be guilty of the affectation
  of straining at such a historical gnat&mdash;nay midge&mdash;as the
  supposition that the mother of Moses was told the story of the Flood by
  Jacob; who had it straight from Shem; who was on friendly terms with
  Methuselah; who knew Adam quite well?</p>

  <p>Yet, by the strange irony of things, the illustrious brother of the
  divine who propounded this remarkable theory, has been the guide and
  foremost worker of that band of investigators of the records of Assyria
  and of Babylonia, who have opened to our view, not merely a new chapter,
  but a new volume of primeval history, relating to the very people who
  have the most numerous points of contact with the life of the ancient
  Hebrews. Now, whatever imperfections may yet obscure the full value of
  the Mesopotamian records, everything that has been clearly ascertained
  tends to the conclusion that the assignment of no more than 4000 years to
  the period between the time of the origin of mankind and that of Augustus
  Cæsar, is wholly inadmissible. Therefore the Biblical <!-- Page 511
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page511"></a>{511}</span>chronology,
  which Canon Rawlinson trusted so implicitly in 1859, is relegated by all
  serious critics to the domain of fable.</p>

  <p>But if scientific method, operating in the region of history, of
  philology, of archæology, in the course of the last thirty or forty
  years, has become thus formidable to the theological dogmatist, what may
  not be said about scientific method working in the province of physical
  science? For, if it be true that the Canonical Scriptures have
  innumerable points of contact with civil history, it is no less true that
  they have almost as many with natural history; and their accuracy is put
  to the test as severely by the latter as by the former. The origin of the
  present state of the heavens and the earth is a problem which lies
  strictly within the province of physical science; so is that of the
  origin of man among living things; so is that of the physical changes
  which the earth has undergone since the origin of man; so is that of the
  origin of the various races and nations of men, with all their varieties
  of language and physical conformation. Whether the earth moves round the
  sun or the contrary; whether the bodily and mental diseases of men and
  animals are caused by evil spirits or not; whether there is such an
  agency as witchcraft or not&mdash;all these are purely scientific
  questions; and to all of them the canonical Scriptures profess to give
  true answers. And though nothing is more common than the assumption that
  these books come into conflict only with the speculative part of modern
  physical science, no assumption can have less foundation. <!-- Page 512
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page512"></a>{512}</span></p>

  <p>The antagonism between natural knowledge and the Pentateuch would be
  as great if the speculations of our time had never been heard of. It
  arises out of contradiction upon matters of fact. The books of
  ecclesiastical authority declare that certain events happened in a
  certain fashion; the books of scientific authority say they did not. As
  it seems that this unquestionable truth has not yet penetrated among many
  of those who speak and write on these subjects, it may be useful to give
  a full illustration of it. And for that purpose I propose to deal, at
  some length, with the narrative of the Noachian Deluge given in
  Genesis.</p>

  <p>&nbsp;</p>

  <p>The Bampton lecturer in 1859, and the Canon of St. Paul's in 1890, are
  in full agreement that this history is true, in the sense in which I have
  defined historical truth. The former is of opinion that the account
  attributed to Berosus records a tradition&mdash;</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>not drawn from the Hebrew record, much less the foundation of that
  record; yet coinciding with it in the most remarkable way. The Babylonian
  version is tricked out with a few extravagances, as the monstrous size of
  the vessel and the translation of Xisuthros; but otherwise it is the
  Hebrew history <i>down to its minutiæ</i> (p. 64).</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>Moreover, correcting Niebuhr, the Bampton lecturer points out that the
  narrative of Berosus implies the universality of the Flood.</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>It is plain that the waters are represented as prevailing above the
  tops of the loftiest mountains in Armenia&mdash;a height which must have
  been seen to involve the submersion of all the countries with which the
  Babylonians were acquainted (p. 66).</p>

</blockquote>

<p><!-- Page 513 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page513"></a>{513}</span></p>

  <p>I may remark, in passing, that many people think the size of Noah's
  ark "monstrous," considering the probable state of the art of
  shipbuilding only 1600 years after the origin of man; while others are so
  unreasonable as to inquire why the translation of Enoch is less an
  "extravagance" than that of Xisuthros. It is more important, however, to
  note that the universality of the Deluge is recognised, not merely as a
  part of the story, but as a necessary consequence of some of its details.
  The latest exponent of Anglican orthodoxy, as we have seen, insists upon
  the accuracy of the Pentateuchal history of the Flood in a still more
  forcible manner. It is cited as one of those very narratives to which the
  authority of the Founder of Christianity is pledged, and upon the
  accuracy of which "the trustworthiness of our Lord Jesus Christ" is
  staked, just as others have staked it upon the truth of the histories of
  demoniac possession in the Gospels.</p>

  <p>Now, when those who put their trust in scientific methods of
  ascertaining the truth in the province of natural history find themselves
  confronted and opposed, on their own ground, by ecclesiastical
  pretensions to better knowledge, it is, undoubtedly, most desirable for
  them to make sure that their conclusions, whatever they may be, are well
  founded. And, if they put aside the unauthorised interference with their
  business and relegate the Pentateuchal history to the region of pure
  fiction, they are bound to assure themselves that they do so because the
  plainest teachings of Nature (apart from all doubtful <!-- Page 514
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page514"></a>{514}</span>speculations)
  are irreconcilable with the assertions which they reject.</p>

  <p>At the present time, it is difficult to persuade serious scientific
  inquirers to occupy themselves, in any way, with the Noachian Deluge.
  They look at you with a smile and a shrug, and say they have more
  important matters to attend to than mere antiquarianism. But it was not
  so in my youth. At that time, geologists and biologists could hardly
  follow to the end any path of inquiry without finding the way blocked by
  Noah and his ark, or by the first chapter of Genesis; and it was a
  serious matter, in this country at any rate, for a man to be suspected of
  doubting the literal truth of the Diluvial or any other Pentateuchal
  history. The fiftieth anniversary of the foundation of the Geological
  Club (in 1824), was, if I remember rightly, the last occasion on which
  the late Sir Charles Lyell spoke to even so small a public as the members
  of that body. Our veteran leader lighted up once more; and, referring to
  the difficulties which beset his early efforts to create a rational
  science of geology, spoke, with his wonted clearness and vigour, of the
  social ostracism which pursued him after the publication of the
  <i>Principles of Geology</i>, in 1830, on account of the obvious tendency
  of that noble work to discredit the Pentateuchal accounts of the Creation
  and the Deluge. If my younger contemporaries find this hard to believe, I
  may refer them to a grave book, <i>On the Doctrine of the Deluge</i>,
  published eight years later, and dedicated by its author to his father,
  the then Archbishop of York. The first chapter <!-- Page 515 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page515"></a>{515}</span>refers to the treatment
  of the "Mosaic Deluge," by Dr. Buckland and Mr. Lyell, in the following
  terms:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>Their respect for revealed religion has prevented them from arraying
  themselves openly against the Scriptural account of it&mdash;much less do
  they deny its truth&mdash;but they are in a great hurry to escape from
  the consideration of it, and evidently concur in the opinion of Linnæus,
  that no proofs whatever of the Deluge are to be discovered in the
  structure of the earth (p. 1).</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>And after an attempt to reply to some of Lyell's arguments, which it
  would be cruel to reproduce, the writer continues:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>When, therefore, upon such slender grounds, it is determined, in
  answer to those who insist upon its universality, that the Mosaic Deluge
  must be considered a preternatural event, far beyond the reach of
  philosophical inquiry; not only as to the causes employed to produce it,
  but as to the effects most likely to result from it; that determination
  wears an aspect of scepticism, which, however much soever it may be
  unintentional in the mind of the writer, yet cannot but produce an evil
  impression on those who are already predisposed to carp and cavil at the
  evidences of Revelation (pp. 8-9).</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>The kindly and courteous writer of these curious passages is evidently
  unwilling to make the geologists the victims of general opprobrium by
  pressing the obvious consequences of their teaching home. One is
  therefore pained to think of the feelings with which, if he lived so long
  as to become acquainted with the <i>Dictionary of the Bible</i>, he must
  have perused the article "Noah," written by a dignitary of the Church for
  that standard compendium and published in 1863. For the doctrine of the
  universality of the Deluge is therein altogether given up; and I <!--
  Page 516 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page516"></a>{516}</span>permit myself to hope that a long
  criticism of the story from the point of view of natural science, with
  which, at the request of the learned theologian who wrote it, I supplied
  him, may, in some degree, have contributed towards this happy result.</p>

  <p>Notwithstanding diligent search, I have been unable to discover that
  the universality of the Deluge has any defender left, at least among
  those who have so far mastered the rudiments of natural knowledge as to
  be able to appreciate the weight of evidence against it. For example,
  when I turned to the <i>Speaker's Bible</i>, published under the sanction
  of high Anglican authority, I found the following judicial and judicious
  deliverance, the skilful wording of which may adorn, but does not hide,
  the completeness of the surrender of the old teaching:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>Without pronouncing too hastily on any fair inferences from the words
  of Scripture, we may reasonably say that their most natural
  interpretation is, that the whole race of man had become grievously
  corrupted since the faithful had intermingled with the ungodly; that the
  inhabited world was consequently filled with violence, and that God had
  decreed to destroy all mankind except one single family; that, therefore,
  all that portion of the earth, perhaps as yet a very small portion, into
  which mankind had spread was overwhelmed with water. The ark was ordained
  to save one faithful family; and lest that family, on the subsidence of
  the waters, should find the whole country round them a desert, a pair of
  all the beasts of the land, and of the fowls of the air were preserved
  along with them, and along with them went forth to replenish the now
  desolated continent. The words of Scripture (confirmed as they are by
  universal tradition) appear at least to mean as much as this. They do not
  necessarily mean more.<a name="NtA148"

<p><!-- Page 517 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page517"></a>{517}</span></p>

  <p>In the third edition of Kitto's <i>Cyclopædia of Biblical
  Literature</i> (1876), the article "Deluge," written by my friend, the
  present distinguished head of the Geological Survey of Great Britain,
  extinguishes the universality doctrine as thoroughly as might be expected
  from its authorship; and, since the writer of the article "Noah" refers
  his readers to that entitled "Deluge," it is to be supposed,
  notwithstanding his generally orthodox tone, that he does not dissent
  from its conclusions. Again, the writers in Herzog's
  <i>Real-Encyclopädie</i> (Bd. X. 1882) and in Riehm's
  <i>Handwörterbuch</i> (1884)&mdash;both works with a conservative
  leaning&mdash;are on the same side; and Diestel,<a name="NtA149"
  href="#Nt149"><sup>[149]</sup></a> in his full discussion of the subject,
  remorselessly rejects the universality doctrine. Even that staunch
  opponent of scientific rationalism&mdash;may I say
  rationality&mdash;Zöckler,<a name="NtA150"
  href="#Nt150"><sup>[150]</sup></a> flinches from a distinct defence of
  the thesis, any opposition to which, well within my recollection, was
  howled down by the orthodox as mere "infidelity." All that, in his sore
  straits, Dr. Zöckler is able to do, is to pronounce a faint commendation
  upon a particularly absurd attempt at reconciliation, which would make
  out the Noachian Deluge to be a catastrophe which occurred at the end of
  the Glacial Epoch. This hypothesis involves only the trifle of a physical
  revolution of which geology knows nothing; and which, if it secured the
  accuracy of the Pentateuchal writer about the fact of the Deluge, would
  leave the details of his <!-- Page 518 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page518"></a>{518}</span>account as irreconcilable with the truths
  of elementary physical science as ever. Thus I may be permitted to spare
  myself and my readers the weariness of a recapitulation of the
  overwhelming arguments against the universality of the Deluge, which they
  will now find for themselves stated, as fully and forcibly as could be
  wished, by Anglican and other theologians, whose orthodoxy and
  conservative tendencies have, hitherto, been above suspicion. Yet many
  fully admit (and, indeed, nothing can be plainer) that the Pentateuchal
  narrator means to convey that, as a matter of fact, the whole earth known
  to him was inundated; nor is it less obvious that, unless all mankind,
  with the exception of Noah and his family, were actually destroyed, the
  references to the Flood in the New Testament are unintelligible.</p>

  <p>But I am quite aware that the strength of the demonstration that no
  universal Deluge ever took place has produced a change of front in the
  army of apologetic writers. They have imagined that the substitution of
  the adjective "partial" for "universal," will save the credit of the
  Pentateuch, and permit them, after all, without too many blushes, to
  declare that the progress of modern science only strengthens the
  authority of Moses. Nowhere have I found the case of the advocates of
  this method of escaping from the difficulties of the actual position
  better put than in the lecture of Professor Diestel to which I have
  referred. After frankly admitting that the old doctrine of universality
  involves physical impossibilities, he continues:&mdash; <!-- Page 519
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page519"></a>{519}</span></p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>All these difficulties fall away as soon as we give up the
  universality of the Deluge, and imagine a <i>partial</i> flooding of the
  earth, say in western Asia. But have we a right to do so? The narrative
  speaks of "the whole earth." But what is the meaning of this expression?
  Surely not the whole surface of the earth according to the ideas of
  <i>modern</i> geographers, but, at most, according to the conceptions of
  the Biblical author. This very simple conclusion, however, is never drawn
  by too many readers of the Bible. But one need only cast one's eyes over
  the tenth chapter of Genesis in order to become acquainted with the
  geographical horizon of the Jews. In the north it was bounded by the
  Black Sea and the mountains of Armenia; extended towards the east very
  little beyond the Tigris; hardly reached the apex of the Persian Gulf;
  passed, then, through the middle of Arabia and the Red Sea; went
  southward through Abyssinia, and then turned westward by the frontiers of
  Egypt, and inclosed the easternmost islands of the Mediterranean (p.
  11).</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>The justice of this observation must be admitted, no less than the
  further remark that, in still earlier times, the pastoral Hebrews very
  probably had yet more restricted notions of what constituted the "whole
  earth." Moreover, I, for one, fully agree with Professor Diestel that the
  motive, or generative incident, of the whole story is to be sought in the
  occasionally excessive and desolating floods of the Euphrates and the
  Tigris.</p>

  <p>Let us, provisionally, accept the theory of a partial deluge, and try
  to form a clear mental picture of the occurrence. Let us suppose that,
  for forty days and forty nights, such a vast quantity of water was poured
  upon the ground that the whole surface of Mesopotamia was covered by
  water to a depth certainly greater, probably much greater, than fifteen
  cubits, or <!-- Page 520 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page520"></a>{520}</span>twenty feet (Gen. vii. 20). The inundation
  prevails upon the earth for one hundred and fifty days; and then the
  flood gradually decreases, until, on the seventeenth day of the seventh
  month, the ark, which had previously floated on its surface, grounds upon
  the "mountains of Ararat"<a name="NtA151"
  href="#Nt151"><sup>[151]</sup></a> (Gen. viii. 34). Then, as Diestel has
  acutely pointed out (<i>Sintflut</i>, p. 13), we are to imagine the
  further subsidence of the flood to take place so gradually that it was
  not until nearly two months and a-half after this time (that is to say,
  on the first day of the tenth month) that the "tops of the mountains"
  became visible. Hence it follows that, if the ark drew even as much as
  twenty feet of water, the level of the inundation fell very
  slowly&mdash;at a rate of only a few inches a day&mdash;until the top of
  the mountain on which it rested became visible. This is an amount of
  movement which, if it took place in the sea, would be overlooked by
  ordinary people on the shore. But the Mesopotamian plain slopes gently,
  from an elevation of 500 or 600 feet at its northern end, to the sea, at
  its southern end, with hardly so much as a notable ridge to break its
  uniform flatness, for 300 to 400 miles. These being the conditions of the
  case, the following inquiry naturally presents itself: not, be it
  observed, as a recondite problem, generated by modern speculation, but as
  a plain suggestion flowing out of that very ordinary and archaic piece of
  knowledge that water cannot be piled up <!-- Page 521 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page521"></a>{521}</span>in a heap, like sand;
  or that it seeks the lowest level. When, after 150 days, "the fountains
  also of the deep and the windows of heaven were stopped, and the rain
  from heaven was restrained" (Gen. viii. 2), what prevented the mass of
  water, several, possibly very many, fathoms deep, which covered, say, the
  present site of Bagdad, from sweeping seaward in a furious torrent; and,
  in a very few hours, leaving, not only the "tops of the mountains," but
  the whole plain, save any minor depressions, bare? How could its
  subsidence, by any possibility, be an affair of weeks and months?</p>

  <p>And if this difficulty is not enough, let any one try to imagine how a
  mass of water several, perhaps very many, fathoms deep, could be
  accumulated on a flat surface of land rising well above the sea, and
  separated from it by no sort of barrier. Most people know Lord's
  Cricket-ground. Would it not be an absurd contradiction to our common
  knowledge of the properties of water to imagine that, if all the mains of
  all the waterworks of London were turned on to it, they could maintain a
  heap of water twenty feet deep over its level surface? Is it not obvious
  that the water, whatever momentary accumulation might take place at
  first, would not stop there, but that it would dash, like a mighty
  mill-race, southwards down the gentle slope which ends in the Thames? And
  is it not further obvious, that whatever depth of water might be
  maintained over the cricket-ground so long as all the mains poured on to
  it, anything which floated there would be speedily whirled away by the
  current, like a cork in a gutter when the rain pours? <!-- Page 522
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page522"></a>{522}</span>But if this is
  so, then it is no less certain that Noah's deeply laden, sailless,
  oarless, and rudderless craft, if by good fortune it escaped capsizing in
  whirlpools, or having its bottom knocked into holes by snags (like those
  which prove fatal even to well-built steamers on the Mississippi in our
  day), would have speedily found itself a good way down the Persian Gulf,
  and not long after in the Indian Ocean, somewhere between Arabia and
  Hindostan. Even if, eventually, the ark might have gone ashore, with
  other jetsam and flotsam, on the coasts of Arabia, or of Hindostan, or of
  the Maldives, or of Madagascar, its return to the "mountains of Ararat"
  would have been a miracle more stupendous than all the rest.</p>

  <p>Thus, the last state of the would-be reconcilers of the story of the
  Deluge with fact is worse than the first. All that they have done is to
  transfer the contradictions to established truth from the region of
  science proper to that of common information and common sense. For,
  really, the assertion that the surface of a body of deep water, to which
  no addition was made, and which there was nothing to stop from running
  into the sea, sank at the rate of only a few inches or even feet a day,
  simply outrages the most ordinary and familiar teachings of every man's
  daily experience. A child may see the folly of it.</p>

  <p>In addition, I may remark that the necessary assumption of the
  "partial Deluge" hypothesis (if it is confined to Mesopotamia) that the
  Hebrew writer must have meant low hills when he said "high mountains," is
  quite untenable. On the eastern side of the <!-- Page 523 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page523"></a>{523}</span>Mesopotamian plain, the
  snowy peaks of the frontier ranges of Persia are visible from Bagdad,<a
  name="NtA152" href="#Nt152"><sup>[152]</sup></a> and even the most
  ignorant herdsmen in the neighbourhood of "Ur of the Chaldees," near its
  western limit, could hardly have been unacquainted with the comparatively
  elevated plateau of the Syrian desert which lay close at hand. But,
  surely, we must suppose the Biblical writer to be acquainted with the
  highlands of Palestine and with the masses of the Sinaitic peninsula,
  which soar more than 8000 feet above the sea, if he knew of no higher
  elevations; and, if so, he could not well have meant to refer to mere
  hillocks when he said that "all the high mountains which were under the
  whole heaven were covered" (Genesis vii. 19). Even the hill-country of
  Galilee reaches an elevation of 4000 feet; and a flood which covered it
  could by no possibility have been other than universal in its superficial
  extent. Water really cannot be got to stand at, say, 4000 feet above the
  sea-level over Palestine, without covering the rest of the globe to the
  same height. Even if, in the course of Noah's six hundredth year, some
  prodigious convulsion had sunk the whole region inclosed within "the
  horizon of the geographical knowledge" of the Israelites by that much,
  and another had pushed it up again, just in time to catch the ark upon
  the "mountains of Ararat," matters are not much mended. I am afraid to
  think of what would have become of a vessel so little seaworthy as the
  ark and of its very numerous passengers, <!-- Page 524 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page524"></a>{524}</span>under the peculiar
  obstacles to quiet flotation which such rapid movements of depression and
  upheaval would have generated.</p>

  <p>Thus, in view, not, I repeat, of the recondite speculations of infidel
  philosophers, but in the face of the plainest and most commonplace of
  ascertained physical facts, the story of the Noachian Deluge has no more
  claim to credit than has that of Deucalion; and whether it was, or was
  not, suggested by the familiar acquaintance of its originators with the
  effects of unusually great overflows of the Tigris and Euphrates, it is
  utterly devoid of historical truth.</p>

  <p>&nbsp;</p>

  <p>That is, in my judgment, the necessary result of the application of
  criticism, based upon assured physical knowledge, to the story of the
  Deluge. And it is satisfactory that the criticism which is based, not
  upon literary and historical speculations, but upon well-ascertained
  facts in the departments of literature and history, tends to exactly the
  same conclusion.</p>

  <p>For I find this much agreed upon by all Biblical scholars of repute,
  that the story of the Deluge in Genesis is separable into at least two
  sets of statements; and that, when the statements thus separated are
  recombined in their proper order, each set furnishes an account of the
  event, coherent and complete within itself, but in some respects
  discordant with that afforded by the other set. This fact, as I
  understand, is not disputed. Whether one of these is the work of an
  Elohist, and the other of a Jehovist narrator; whether the two have been
  pieced together in this <!-- Page 525 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page525"></a>{525}</span>strange fashion because, in the estimation
  of the compilers and editors of the Pentateuch, they had equal and
  independent authority, or not; or whether there is some other way of
  accounting for it&mdash;are questions the answers to which do not affect
  the fact. If possible I avoid <i>à priori</i> arguments. But still, I
  think it may be urged, without imprudence, that a narrative having this
  structure is hardly such as might be expected from a writer possessed of
  full and infallibly accurate knowledge. Once more, it would seem that it
  is not necessarily the mere inclination of the sceptical spirit to
  question everything, or the wilful blindness of infidels, which prompts
  grave doubts as to the value of a narrative thus curiously unlike the
  ordinary run of veracious histories.</p>

  <p>But the voice of archæological and historical criticism still has to
  be heard; and it gives forth no uncertain sound. The marvellous recovery
  of the records of an antiquity, far superior to any that can be ascribed
  to the Pentateuch, which has been effected by the decipherers of
  cuneiform characters, has put us in possession of a series, once more,
  not of speculations, but of facts, which have a most remarkable bearing
  upon the question of the trustworthiness of the narrative of the Flood.
  It is established, that for centuries before the asserted migration of
  Terah from Ur of the Chaldees (which, according to the orthodox
  interpreters of the Pentateuch, took place after the year 2000 <span
  class="scac">B.C.</span>) Lower Mesopotamia was the seat of a
  civilisation in which art and science and literature had attained a
  development formerly unsuspected, or, <!-- Page 526 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page526"></a>{526}</span>if there were faint
  reports of it, treated as fabulous. And it is also no matter of
  speculation, but a fact, that the libraries of these people contain
  versions of a long epic poem, one of the twelve books of which tells a
  story of a deluge, which, in a number of its leading features,
  corresponds with the story attributed to Berosus, no less than with the
  story given in Genesis, with curious exactness. Thus, the correctness of
  Canon Rawlinson's conclusion, cited above, that the story of Berosus was
  neither drawn from the Hebrew record, nor is the foundation of it, can
  hardly be questioned. It is highly probable, if not certain, that Berosus
  relied upon one of the versions (for there seem to have been several) of
  the old Babylonian epos, extant in his time; and, if that is a reasonable
  conclusion, why is it unreasonable to believe that the two stories, which
  the Hebrew compiler has put together in such an inartistic fashion, were
  ultimately derived from the same source? I say ultimately, because it
  does not at all follow that the two versions, possibly trimmed by the
  Jehovistic writer on the one hand, and by the Elohistic on the other, to
  suit Hebrew requirements, may not have been current among the Israelites
  for ages. And they may have acquired great authority before they were
  combined in the Pentateuch.</p>

  <p>Looking at the convergence of all these lines of evidence to the one
  conclusion&mdash;that the story of the Flood in Genesis is merely a
  Bowdlerised version of one of the oldest pieces of purely fictitious
  literature extant; that whether this is, or is not, its origin, the <!--
  Page 527 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page527"></a>{527}</span>events asserted in it to have taken place
  assuredly never did take place; further, that, in point of fact, the
  story, in the plain and logically necessary sense of its words, has long
  since been given up by orthodox and conservative commentators of the
  Established Church&mdash;I can but admire the courage and clear foresight
  of the Anglican divine who tells us that we must be prepared to choose
  between the trustworthiness of scientific method and the trustworthiness
  of that which the Church declares to be Divine authority. For, to my
  mind, this declaration of war to the knife against secular science, even
  in its most elementary form; this rejection without a moment's hesitation
  of any and all evidence which conflicts with theological dogma&mdash;is
  the only position which is logically reconcilable with the axioms of
  orthodoxy. If the Gospels truly report that which an incarnation of the
  God of Truth communicated to the world, then it surely is absurd to
  attend to any other evidence touching matters about which he made any
  clear statement, or the truth of which is distinctly implied by his
  words. If the exact historical truth of the Gospels is an axiom of
  Christianity, it is as just and right for a Christian to say, Let us
  "close our ears against suggestions" of scientific critics, as it is for
  the man of science to refuse to waste his time upon circle-squarers and
  flat-earth fanatics.</p>

  <p>It is commonly reported that the manifesto by which the Canon of St.
  Paul's proclaims that he nails the colours of the straitest Biblical
  infallibility to the mast of the ship ecclesiastical, was put forth as a
  <!-- Page 528 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page528"></a>{528}</span>counterblast to <i>Lux Mundi</i>; and that
  the passages which I have more particularly quoted are directed against
  the essay on "The Holy Spirit and Inspiration" in that collection of
  treatises by Anglican divines of high standing, who must assuredly be
  acquitted of conscious "infidel" proclivities. I fancy that rumour must,
  for once, be right, for it is impossible to imagine a more direct and
  diametrical contradiction than that between the passages from the sermon
  cited above and those which follow:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>What is questioned is that our Lord's words foreclose certain critical
  positions as to the character of Old Testament literature. For example,
  does His use of Jonah's resurrection as a <i>type</i> of His own, depend
  in any real degree upon whether it is historical fact or allegory?...
  Once more, our Lord uses the time before the Flood, to illustrate the
  carelessness of men before His own coming.... In referring to the Flood
  He certainly suggests that He is treating it as typical, for He
  introduces circumstances&mdash;"eating and drinking, marrying and giving
  in marriage"&mdash;which have no counterpart in the original narrative
  (p. 358-9).</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>While insisting on the flow of inspiration through the whole of the
  Old Testament, the essayist does not admit its universality. Here, also,
  the new apologetic demands a partial flood:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>But does the inspiration of the recorder guarantee the exact
  historical truth of what he records? And, in matter of fact, can the
  record, with due regard to legitimate historical criticism, be pronounced
  true? Now, to the latter of these two questions (and they are quite
  distinct questions) we may reply that there is nothing to prevent our
  believing, as our faith strongly disposes us to believe, that the record
  from Abraham downward is, in substance, in the strict sense historical
  (p. 351).</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>It would appear, therefore, that there is nothing <!-- Page 529
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page529"></a>{529}</span>to prevent our
  believing that the record, from Abraham upward, consists of stories in
  the strict sense unhistorical, and that the pre-Abrahamic narratives are
  mere moral and religious "types" and parables.</p>

  <p>I confess I soon lose my way when I try to follow those who walk
  delicately among "types" and allegories. A certain passion for clearness
  forces me to ask, bluntly, whether the writer means to say that Jesus did
  not believe the stories in question, or that he did? When Jesus spoke, as
  of a matter of fact, that "the Flood came and destroyed them all," did he
  believe that the Deluge really took place, or not? It seems to me that,
  as the narrative mentions Noah's wife, and his sons' wives, there is good
  scriptural warranty for the statement that the antediluvians married and
  were given in marriage; and I should have thought that their eating and
  drinking might be assumed by the firmest believer in the literal truth of
  the story. Moreover, I venture to ask what sort of value, as an
  illustration of God's methods of dealing with sin, has an account of an
  event that never happened? If no Flood swept the careless people away,
  how is the warning of more worth than the cry of "Wolf" when there is no
  wolf? If Jonah's three days' residence in the whale is not an "admitted
  reality," how could it "warrant belief" in the "coming resurrection?" If
  Lot's wife was not turned into a pillar of salt, the bidding those who
  turn back from the narrow path to "remember" it is, morally, about on a
  level with telling a naughty child that a bogy is <!-- Page 530 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page530"></a>{530}</span>coming to fetch it
  away. Suppose that a Conservative orator warns his hearers to beware of
  great political and social changes, lest they end, as in France, in the
  domination of a Robespierre; what becomes, not only of his argument, but
  of his veracity, if he, personally, does not believe that Robespierre
  existed and did the deeds attributed to him?</p>

  <p>Like all other attempts to reconcile the results of
  scientifically-conducted investigation with the demands of the outworn
  creeds of ecclesiasticism, the essay on Inspiration is just such a
  failure as must await mediation, when the mediator is unable properly to
  appreciate the weight of the evidence for the case of one of the two
  parties. The question of "Inspiration" really possesses no interest for
  those who have cast ecclesiasticism and all its works aside, and have no
  faith in any source of truth save that which is reached by the patient
  application of scientific methods. Theories of inspiration are
  speculations as to the means by which the authors of statements, in the
  Bible or elsewhere, have been led to say what they have said&mdash;and it
  assumes that natural agencies are insufficient for the purpose. I prefer
  to stop short of this problem, finding it more profitable to undertake
  the inquiry which naturally precedes it&mdash;namely, Are these
  statements true or false? If they are true, it may be worth while to go
  into the question of their supernatural generation; if they are false, it
  certainly is not worth mine.</p>

  <p>Now, not only do I hold it to be proven that the story of the Deluge
  is a pure fiction; but I have no <!-- Page 531 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page531"></a>{531}</span>hesitation in affirming
  the same thing of the story of the Creation.<a name="NtA153"
  href="#Nt153"><sup>[153]</sup></a> Between these two lies the story of
  the creation of man and woman and their fall from primitive innocence,
  which is even more monstrously improbable than either of the other two,
  though, from the nature of the case, it is not so easily capable of
  direct refutation. It can be demonstrated that the earth took longer than
  six days in the making, and that the Deluge, as described, is a physical
  impossibility; but there is no proving, especially to those who are
  perfect in the art of closing their ears to that which they do not wish
  to hear, that a snake did not speak, or that Eve was not made out of one
  of Adam's ribs.</p>

  <p>The compiler of Genesis, in its present form, evidently had a definite
  plan in his mind. His countrymen, like all other men, were doubtless
  curious to know how the world began; how men, and especially wicked men,
  came into being, and how existing nations and races arose among the
  descendants of one stock; and, finally, what was the history of their own
  particular tribe. They, like ourselves, desired to solve the four great
  problems of cosmogeny, anthropogeny, ethnogeny, and geneogeny. The
  Pentateuch <!-- Page 532 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page532"></a>{532}</span>furnishes the solutions which appeared
  satisfactory to its author. One of these, as we have seen, was borrowed
  from a Babylonian fable; and I know of no reason to suspect any different
  origin for the rest. Now, I would ask, is the story of the fabrication of
  Eve to be regarded as one of those pre-Abrahamic narratives, the
  historical truth of which is an open question, in face of the reference
  to it in a speech unhappily famous for the legal oppression to which it
  has been wrongfully forced to lend itself?</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>Have ye not read, that he which made them from the beginning made them
  male and female, and said, For this cause shall a man leave his father
  and mother, and cleave to his wife; and the twain shall become one flesh?
  (Matt. xix. 5).</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>If divine authority is not here claimed for the twenty-fourth verse of
  the second chapter of Genesis, what is the value of language? And again,
  I ask, if one may play fast and loose with the story of the Fall as a
  "type" or "allegory," what becomes of the foundation of Pauline
  theology?&mdash;</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>For since by man came death, by man came also the resurrection of the
  dead. For as in Adam all die, so also in Christ shall all be made alive
  (1 Corinthians xv. 21, 22).</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>If Adam may be held to be no more real a personage than Prometheus,
  and if the story of the Fall is merely an instructive "type," comparable
  to the profound Promethean mythus, what value has Paul's dialectic?</p>

  <p>While, therefore, every right-minded man must sympathise with the
  efforts of those theologians, who <!-- Page 533 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page533"></a>{533}</span>have not been able
  altogether to close their ears to the still, small voice of reason, to
  escape from the fetters which ecclesiasticism has forged, the melancholy
  fact remains, that the position they have taken up is hopelessly
  untenable. It is raked alike by the old-fashioned artillery of the
  Churches and by the fatal weapons of precision with which the <i>enfants
  perdus</i> of the advancing forces of science are armed. They must
  surrender, or fall back into a more sheltered position. And it is
  possible that they may long find safety in such retreat.</p>

  <p>It is, indeed, probable that the proportional number of those who will
  distinctly profess their belief in the transubstantiation of Lot's wife,
  and the anticipatory experience of submarine navigation by Jonah; in
  water standing fathoms deep on the side of a declivity without anything
  to hold it up; and in devils who enter swine&mdash;will not increase. But
  neither is there ground for much hope that the proportion of those who
  cast aside these fictions and adopt the consequence of that repudiation,
  are, for some generations, likely to constitute a majority. Our age is a
  day of compromises. The present and the near future seem given over to
  those happily, if curiously, constituted people who see as little
  difficulty in throwing aside any amount of post-Abrahamic Scriptural
  narrative, as the authors of <i>Lux Mundi</i> see in sacrificing the
  pre-Abrahamic stories; and, having distilled away every inconvenient
  matter of fact in Christian history, continue to pay divine honours to
  the residue. There really seems to be no reason why the next generation
  <!-- Page 534 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page534"></a>{534}</span>should not listen to a Bampton Lecture
  modelled upon that addressed to the last:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>Time was&mdash;and that not very long ago&mdash;when all the relations
  of Biblical authors concerning the old world were received with a ready
  belief; and an unreasoning and uncritical faith accepted with equal

  the court of Pharaoh, the account of the Apostolic meeting in the Epistle
  to the Galatians, and that of the fabrication of Eve. We can most of us
  remember when, in this country, the whole story of the Exodus, and even
  the legend of Jonah, were seriously placed before boys as history, and
  discoursed of in as dogmatic a tone as the tale of Agincourt or the
  history of the Norman Conquest.</p>

  <p>But all this is now changed. The last century has seen the growth of
  scientific criticism to its full strength. The whole world of history has
  been revolutionised and the mythology which embarrassed earnest
  Christians has vanished as an evil mist, the lifting of which has only
  more fully revealed the lineaments of infallible Truth. No longer in
  contact with fact of any kind, Faith stands now and for ever proudly
  inaccessible to the attacks of the infidel.</p>

<h3>XIV</h3>

<h3>THE KEEPERS OF THE HERD OF SWINE</h3>

  <p>I had fondly hoped that Mr. Gladstone and I had come to an end of
  disputation, and that the hatchet of war was finally superseded by the
  calumet, which, as Mr. Gladstone, I believe, objects to tobacco, I was
  quite willing to smoke for both. But I have had, once again, to discover
  that the adage that whoso seeks peace will ensue it, is a somewhat hasty
  generalisation. The renowned warrior with whom it is my misfortune to be
  opposed in most things has dug up the axe and is on the war-path once
  more. The weapon has been wielded with all the dexterity which long
  practice has conferred on a past master in craft, whether of wood or
  state. And I have reason to believe that the simpler sort of the great
  tribe which he heads imagine that my scalp is already on its way to adorn
  their big chief's wigwam. I am glad therefore to be able to relieve any
  anxieties which my friends may entertain without delay. I assure them
  that my skull retains its normal covering, and that though, naturally, I
  may have felt alarmed, nothing serious has happened. My doughty <!-- Page
  536 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page536"></a>{536}</span>adversary
  has merely performed a war dance, and his blows have for the most part
  cut the air. I regret to add, however, that by misadventure, and I am
  afraid I must say carelessness, he has inflicted one or two severe
  contusions on himself.</p>

  <p>When the noise of approaching battle roused me from the dreams of
  peace which occupy my retirement, I was glad to observe (since I must
  fight) that the campaign was to be opened upon a new field. When the
  contest raged over the Pentateuchal myth of the creation, Mr. Gladstone's
  manifest want of acquaintance with the facts and principles involved in
  the discussion, no less than with the best literature on his own side of
  the subject, gave me the uncomfortable feeling that I had my adversary at
  a disadvantage. The sun of science, at my back, was in his eyes. But, on
  the present occasion, we are happily on an equality. History and Biblical
  criticism are as much, or as little, my vocation as they are that of Mr.
  Gladstone; the blinding from too much light, or the blindness from too
  little, may be presumed to be equally shared by both of us.</p>

  <p>Mr. Gladstone takes up his new position in the country of the
  Gadarenes. His strategic sense justly leads him to see that the authority
  of the teachings of the synoptic Gospels, touching the nature of the
  spiritual world, turns upon the acceptance or the rejection of the
  Gadarene and other like stories. As we accept or repudiate such histories
  as that of the possessed pigs, so shall we <!-- Page 537 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page537"></a>{537}</span>accept or reject the
  witness of the synoptics to such miraculous interventions.</p>

  <p>It is exactly because these stories constitute the key-stone of the
  orthodox arch, that I originally drew attention to them; and, in spite of
  my longing for peace, I am truly obliged to Mr. Gladstone for compelling
  me to place my case before the public once more. It may be thought that
  this is a work of supererogation by those who are aware that my essay is
  the subject of attack in a work so largely circulated as the
  <i>Impregnable Rock of Holy Scripture</i>; and who may possibly, in their
  simplicity, assume that it must be truthfully set forth in that work. But
  the warmest admirers of Mr. Gladstone will hardly be prepared to maintain
  that mathematical accuracy in stating the opinions of an opponent is the
  most prominent feature of his controversial method. And what follows will
  show that, in the present case, the desire to be fair and accurate, the
  existence of which I am bound to assume, has not borne as much fruit as
  might have been expected.</p>

  <p>In referring to the statement of the narrators that the herd of swine
  perished in consequence of the entrance into them of the demons by the
  permission, or order, of Jesus of Nazareth, I said:</p>

  <p>"Everything that I know of law and justice convinces me that the
  wanton destruction of other people's property is a misdemeanour of evil
  example" (<i>Nineteenth Century</i>, February 1889, p. 172).</p>

  <p>Mr. Gladstone has not found it convenient to cite this passage; and,
  in view of various considerations, <!-- Page 538 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page538"></a>{538}</span>I dare not assume that
  he would assent to it, without sundry subtle modifications which, for me,
  might possibly rob it of its argumentative value. But, until the
  proposition is seriously controverted, I shall assume it to be true, and
  content myself with warning the reader that neither he nor I have any
  grounds for assuming Mr. Gladstone's concurrence. With this caution, I
  proceed to remark that I think it may be granted that the people whose
  herd of 2000 swine (more or fewer) was suddenly destroyed suffered great
  loss and damage. And it is quite certain that the narrators of the
  Gadarene story do not, in any way, refer to the point of morality and
  legality thus raised; as I said, they show no inkling of the moral and
  legal difficulties which arise.</p>

  <p>Such being the facts of the case, I submit that for those who admit
  the principle laid down, the conclusion which I have drawn necessarily
  follows; though I repeat that, since Mr. Gladstone does not explicitly
  admit the principle, I am far from suggesting that he is bound by its
  logical consequences. However, I distinctly repeat the opinion that any
  one who acted in the way described in the story would, in my judgment, be
  guilty of "a misdemeanour of evil example." About that point I desire to
  leave no ambiguity whatever; and it follows that, if I believed the
  story, I should have no hesitation in applying this judgment to the chief
  actor in it.</p>

  <p>But if any one will do me the favour to turn to the paper in which
  these passages occur, he will find that a considerable part of it is
  devoted to the <!-- Page 539 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page539"></a>{539}</span>exposure of the familiar trick of the
  "counsel for creeds," who, when they wish to profit by the easily stirred
  <i>odium theologicum</i>, are careful to confuse disbelief in a narrative
  of a man's act, or disapproval of the acts as narrated, with disbelieving
  and vilipending the man himself. If I say that "according to paragraphs
  in several newspapers, my valued Separatist friend A.&nbsp;B. has houghed a
  lot of cattle which he considered to be unlawfully in the possession of
  an Irish land-grabber; that in my opinion any such act is a misdemeanour
  of evil example; but that I utterly disbelieve the whole story and have
  no doubt that it is a mere fabrication:" it really appears to me that, if
  any one charges me with calling A.&nbsp;B. an immoral misdemeanant, I should
  be justified in using very strong language respecting either his sanity
  or his veracity. And, if an analogous charge has been brought in
  reference to the Gadarene story, there is certainly no excuse producible
  on account of any lack of plain speech on my part. Surely no language can
  be more explicit than that which follows:</p>

  <p>"I can discern no escape from this dilemma; either Jesus said what he
  is reported to have said, or he did not. In the former case, it is
  inevitable that his authority on matters connected with the 'unseen
  world' should be roughly shaken; in the latter, the blow falls upon the
  authority of the synoptic Gospels" (p. 173). "The choice then lies
  between discrediting those who compiled the gospel biographies and
  disbelieving the Master, whom <!-- Page 540 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page540"></a>{540}</span>they, simple souls, thought to honour by
  preserving such traditions of the exercise of his authority over Satan's
  invisible world" (p. 174). And I leave no shadow of doubt as to my own
  choice: "After what has been said, I do not think that any sensible man,
  unless he happen to be angry, will accuse <span class="correction"
  title="Omitted in original.">me</span> of 'contradicting the Lord and his
  Apostles' if I reiterate my total disbelief in the whole Gadarene story"
  (p. 178).</p>

  <p>I am afraid, therefore, that Mr. Gladstone must have been exceedingly
  angry when he committed himself to such a statement as follows:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>So, then, after eighteen centuries of worship offered to our Lord by
  the most cultivated, the most developed, and the most progressive portion
  of the human race, it has been reserved to a scientific inquirer to
  discover that He was no better than a law-breaker and an evil-doer....
  How, in such a matter, came the honours of originality to be reserved to
  our time and to Professor Huxley? (pp. 269, 270.)</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>Truly, the hatchet is hardly a weapon of precision, but would seem to
  have rather more the character of the boomerang, which returns to damage
  the reckless thrower. Doubtless such incidents are somewhat ludicrous.
  But they have a very serious side; and, if I rated the opinion of those
  who blindly follow Mr. Gladstone's leading, but not light, in these
  matters, much higher than the great Duke of Wellington's famous standard
  of minimum value, I think I might fairly beg them to reflect upon the
  general bearings of this particular example of his controversial method.
  I imagine it can hardly commend itself to their cool judgment. <!-- Page
  541 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page541"></a>{541}</span></p>

  <p>After this tragi-comical ending to what an old historian calls a
  "robustious and rough coming on"; and after some praises of the
  provisions of the Mosaic law in the matter of not eating pork&mdash;in
  which, as pork disagrees with me and for some other reasons, I am much
  disposed to concur, though I do not see what they have to do with the
  matter in hand&mdash;comes the serious onslaught.</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>Mr. Huxley, exercising his rapid judgment on the text, does not appear
  to have encumbered himself with the labour of inquiring what anybody else
  had known or said about it. He has thus missed a point which might have
  been set up in support of his accusation against our Lord (p. 273).</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>Unhappily for my comfort, I have been much exercised in controversy
  during the past thirty years; and the only compensation for the loss of
  time and the trials of temper which it has inflicted upon me, is that I
  have come to regard it as a branch of the fine arts, and to take an
  impartial and æsthetic interest in the way it is conducted, even by those
  whose efforts are directed against myself. Now, from the purely artistic
  point of view (which, as we are all being told, has nothing to do with
  morals), I consider it an axiom, that one should never appear to doubt
  that the other side has performed the elementary duty of acquiring proper
  elementary information, unless there is demonstrative evidence to the
  contrary. And I think, though I admit that this may be a purely
  subjective appreciation, that (unless you are quite certain) there is a
  "want of finish," as a great <!-- Page 542 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page542"></a>{542}</span>master of disputation once put it, about
  the suggestion that your opponent has missed a point on his own side.
  Because it may happen that he has not missed it at all, but only thought
  it unworthy of serious notice. And if he proves that, the suggestion
  looks foolish.</p>

  <p>Merely noting the careful repetition of a charge, the absurdity of
  which has been sufficiently exposed above, I now ask my readers to
  accompany me on a little voyage of discovery in search of the side on
  which the rapid judgment and the ignorance of the literature of the
  subject lie. I think I may promise them very little trouble, and a good
  deal of entertainment.</p>

  <p>Mr. Gladstone is of opinion that the Gadarene swinefolk were "Hebrews
  bound by the Mosaic law" (p. 274), and he conceives that it has not
  occurred to me to learn what may be said in favour of and against this
  view. He tells us that</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>Some commentators have alleged the authority of Josephus for stating
  that Gadara was a city of Greeks rather than of Jews, from whence it
  might be inferred that to keep swine was innocent and lawful (p.
  273).</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>Mr. Gladstone then goes on to inform his readers that in his
  painstaking search after truth he has submitted to the labour of
  personally examining the writings of Josephus. Moreover, in a note, he
  positively exhibits an acquaintance, in addition, with the works of
  Bishop Wordsworth and of Archbishop Trench; and even shows that he has
  read Hudson's commentary on Josephus. And yet people say that <!-- Page
  543 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page543"></a>{543}</span>our
  Biblical critics do not equal the Germans in research! But Mr.
  Gladstone's citation of Cuvier and Sir John Herschel about the Creation
  myth, and his ignorance of all the best modern writings on his own side,
  produced a great impression on my mind. I have had the audacity to
  suspect that his acquaintance with what has been done in biblical history
  might stand at no higher level than his information about the natural
  sciences. However unwillingly, I have felt bound to consider the
  possibility that Mr. Gladstone's labours in this matter may have carried
  him no further than Josephus and the worthy, but somewhat antique,
  episcopal and other authorities to whom he refers; that even his reading
  of Josephus may have been of the most cursory nature, directed not to the
  understanding of his author, but to the discovery of useful controversial
  matter; and that, in view of the not inconsiderable misrepresentation of
  my statements to which I have drawn attention, it might be that Mr.
  Gladstone's exposition of the evidence of Josephus was not more
  trustworthy. I proceed to show that my previsions have been fully
  justified. I doubt if controversial literature contains anything more
  <i>piquant</i> than the story I have to unfold.</p>

  <p>That I should be reproved for rapidity of judgment is very just:
  however quaint the situation of Mr. Gladstone, as the reprover, may seem
  to people blessed with a sense of humour. But it is a quality, the
  defects of which have been painfully obvious to me all my life; and I try
  to keep my Pegasus&mdash;at <!-- Page 544 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page544"></a>{544}</span>best a poor Shetland variety of that
  species of quadruped&mdash;at a respectable jog-trot, by loading him
  heavily with bales of reading. Those who took the trouble to study my
  paper in good faith, and not for mere controversial purposes, have a
  right to know, that something more than a hasty glimpse of two or three
  passages of Josephus (even with as many episcopal works thrown in) lay at
  the back of the few paragraphs I devoted to the Gadarene story. I proceed
  to set forth, as briefly as I can, some results of that preparatory work.
  My artistic principles do not permit me, at present, to express a doubt
  that Mr. Gladstone was acquainted with the facts I am about to mention
  when he undertook to write. But, if he did know them, then both what he
  has said and what he has not said, his assertions and his omissions
  alike, will require a paragraph to themselves.</p>

  <p>The common consent of the synoptic Gospels affirms that the miraculous
  transference of devils from a man, or men, to sundry pigs took place
  somewhere on the eastern shore of the Lake of Tiberias; "on the other
  side of the sea over against Galilee," the western shore being, without
  doubt, included in the latter province. But there is no such concord when
  we come to the name of the part of the eastern shore on which, according
  to the story, Jesus and his disciples landed. In the revised version
  Matthew calls it the "country of the Gadarenes:" Luke and Mark have
  "Gerasenes." In sundry very ancient manuscripts "Gergesenes" occurs. <!--
  Page 545 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page545"></a>{545}</span></p>

  <p>The existence of any place called Gergesa, however, is declared by the
  weightiest authorities whom I have consulted to be very questionable; and
  no such town is mentioned in the list of the cities of the Decapolis, in
  the territory of which (as it would seem from Mark v. 20) the transaction
  was supposed to take place. About Gerasa, on the other hand, there hangs
  no such doubt. It was a large and important member of the group of the
  Decapolitan cities. But Gerasa is more than thirty miles distant from the
  nearest part of the Lake of Tiberias, while the city mentioned in the
  narrative could not have been very far off the scene of the event.
  However, as Gerasa was a very important Hellenic city, not much more than
  a score of miles from Gadara, it is easily imaginable that a locality
  which was part of Decapolitan territory may have been spoken of as
  belonging to one of the two cities, when it really appertained to the
  other. After weighing all the arguments, no doubt remains on my mind that
  "Gadarene" is the proper reading. At the period under consideration,
  Gadara appears to have been a good-sized fortified town, about two miles
  in circumference. It was a place of considerable strategic importance,
  inasmuch as it lay on a high ridge at the point of intersection of the
  roads from Tiberias, Scythopolis, Damascus, and Gerasa. Three miles north
  from it, where the Tiberias road descended into the valley of the
  Hieromices, lay the famous hot springs and the fashionable baths of
  Amatha. On the north-east side, the remains of the extensive necropolis
  of Gadara are still to be seen. <!-- Page 546 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page546"></a>{546}</span>Innumerable sepulchral chambers are
  excavated in the limestone cliffs, and many of them still contain
  sarcophaguses of basalt; while not a few are converted into dwellings by
  the inhabitants of the present village of Um Keis. The distance of Gadara
  from the south-eastern shore of the Lake of Tiberias is less than seven
  miles. The nearest of the other cities of the Decapolis, to the north, is
  Hippos, which also lay some seven miles off on the south-eastern corner
  of the shore of the lake. In accordance with the ancient Hellenic
  practice that each city should be surrounded by a certain amount of
  territory amenable to its jurisdiction,<a name="NtA154"
  href="#Nt154"><sup>[154]</sup></a> and on the other grounds, it may be
  taken for certain that the intermediate country was divided between
  Gadara and Hippos, and that the citizens of Gadara had free access to a
  port on the lake. Hence the title of "country of the Gadarenes" applied
  to the locality of the porcine catastrophe becomes easily intelligible.
  The swine may well be imagined to have been feeding (as they do now in
  the adjacent region) on the hillsides, which slope somewhat steeply down
  to the lake from the northern boundary wall of the valley of the
  Hieromices (<i>Nahr Yarmuk</i>), about half-way between the city and the
  shore, and doubtless lay well within the territory of the <i>polis</i> of
  Gadara.</p>

  <p>The proof that Gadara was, to all intents and purposes, a Gentile and
  not a Jewish city is complete. <!-- Page 547 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page547"></a>{547}</span>The date and the occasion of its
  foundation are unknown; but it certainly existed in the third century
  <span class="scac">B.C.</span> Antiochus the Great annexed it to his
  dominions in <span class="scac">B.C.</span> 198. After this, during the
  brief revival of Jewish autonomy, Alexander Jannæus took it; and for the
  first time, so far as the records go, it fell under Jewish rule.<a
  name="NtA155" href="#Nt155"><sup>[155]</sup></a> From this it was rescued
  by Pompey (<span class="scac">B.C.</span> 63), who rebuilt the city and
  incorporated it with the province of Syria. In gratitude to the Romans
  for the dissolution of a hated union, the Gadarenes adopted the Pompeian
  era on their coinage. Gadara was a commercial centre of some importance,
  and therefore, it may be assumed, Jews settled in it, as they settled in
  almost all considerable Gentile cities. But a wholly mistaken estimate of
  the magnitude of the Jewish colony has been based upon the notion that
  Gabinius, proconsul of Syria in 57-55 <span class="scac">B.C.</span>,
  seated one of the five sanhedrims in Gadara. Schürer has pointed out that
  what he really did was to lodge one of them in Gazara, far away on the
  other side of the Jordan. This is one of the many errors which have
  arisen out of the confusion of the names Ga<i>d</i>ara, Ga<i>z</i>ara,
  and Ga<i>b</i>ara.</p>

  <p>Augustus made a present of Gadara to Herod the Great, as an appanage
  personal to himself; and, upon Herod's death, recognising it to be a
  "Grecian city like Hippos and Gaza,"<a name="NtA156"
  href="#Nt156"><sup>[156]</sup></a> he transferred it back to its former
  <!-- Page 548 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page548"></a>{548}</span>place in the province of Syria. That Herod
  made no effort to judaise his temporary possession, but rather the
  contrary, is obvious from the fact that the coins of Gadara, while under
  his rule, bear the image of Augustus with the superscription <span
  title="Sebastos" class="grk"
  >&Sigma;&epsilon;&beta;&alpha;&sigma;&tau;&#x1F79;&sigmaf;</span>&mdash;a
  flying in the face of Jewish prejudices which even he did not dare to
  venture upon in Judæa. And I may remark that, if my co-trustee of the
  British Museum had taken the trouble to visit the splendid numismatic
  collection under our charge, he might have seen two coins of Gadara, one
  of the time of Tiberius and the other of that of Titus, each bearing the
  effigies of the emperor on the obverse: while the personified genius of
  the city is on the reverse of the former. Further, the well-known works
  of De Saulcy and of Ekhel would have supplied the information that, from
  the time of Augustus to that of Gordian, the Gadarene coinage had the
  same thoroughly Gentile character. Curious that a city of "Hebrews bound
  by the Mosaic law" should tolerate such a mint!</p>

  <p>Whatever increase in population the Ghetto of Gadara may have
  undergone between <span class="scac">B.C.</span> 4 and <span
  class="scac">A.D.</span> 66, it nowise affected the Gentile and
  anti-Judaic character of the city at the outbreak of the great war; for
  Josephus tells us that immediately after the great massacre at Cæsarea,
  the revolted Jews "laid waste the villages of the Syrians and their
  neighbouring cities, Philadelphia and Sebonitis and Gerasa and Pella and
  Scythopolis, and after them Gadara and Hippos" (<i>Wars</i>, II. xviii.
  1). I submit that if Gadara had been a city of "Hebrews bound by the <!--
  Page 549 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page549"></a>{549}</span>Mosaic law," the ravaging of their
  territory by their brother Jews in revenge for the massacre of the
  Cæsarean Jews by the Gentile population of that place, would surely have
  been a somewhat unaccountable proceeding. But when we proceed a little
  further, to the fifth section of the chapter in which this statement
  occurs, the whole affair becomes intelligible enough.</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>Besides this murder at Scythopolis, the other cities rose up against
  the Jews that were among them: those of Askelon slew two thousand five
  hundred, and those of Ptolemais two thousand, and put not a few into
  bonds; those of Tyre also put a great number to death, but kept a greater
  number in prison; moreover, those of Hippos and those of Gadara did the
  like, while they put to death the boldest of the Jews, but kept those of
  whom they were most afraid in custody; as did the rest of the cities of
  Syria according as they every one either hated them or were afraid of
  them.</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>Josephus is not always trustworthy, but he has no conceivable motive
  for altering facts here; he speaks of contemporary events, in which he
  himself took an active part, and he characterises the cities in the way
  familiar to him. For Josephus, Gadara is just as much a Gentile city as
  Ptolemais; it was reserved for his latest commentator, either ignoring,
  or ignorant of, all this, to tell us that Gadara had a Hebrew population
  bound by the Mosaic law.</p>

  <p>In the face of all this evidence, most of which has been put before
  serious students, with full reference to the needful authorities and in a
  thoroughly judicial manner, by Schürer in his classical work,<a
  name="NtA157" href="#Nt157"><sup>[157]</sup></a> one reads <!-- Page 550
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page550"></a>{550}</span>with
  stupefaction the statement which Mr. Gladstone has thought fit to put
  before the uninstructed public:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>Some commentators have alleged the authority of Josephus for stating
  that Gadara was a city of Greeks rather than of Jews, from whence it
  might be inferred that to keep swine was innocent and lawful. This is not
  quite the place for a critical examination of the matter; but I have
  examined it, and have satisfied myself that Josephus gives no reason
  whatever to suppose that the population of Gadara, and still less (if
  less may be) the population of the neighbourhood, and least of all the
  swine-herding or lower portion of that population, were other than
  Hebrews bound by the Mosaic law. (Pp. 373-4.)</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>Even "rapid judgment" cannot be pleaded in excuse for this surprising
  statement, because a "Note on the Gadarene miracle" is added (in a
  special appendix), in which the references are given to the passages of
  Josephus, by the improved interpretation of which Mr. Gladstone has thus
  contrived to satisfy himself of the thing which is not. One of these is
  <i>Antiquities</i>, XVII. xiii. 4, in which section I regret to say I can
  find no mention of Gadara. In <i>Antiquities</i>, XVII. xi. 4, however,
  there is a passage which would appear to be that which Mr. Gladstone
  means, and I will give it in full, although I have already cited part of
  it:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>There were also certain of the cities which paid tribute to Archelaus;
  Strato's tower, and Sebaste, with Joppa and Jerusalem; for, as to Gaza,
  Gadara, and Hippos, they were Grecian cities, which Cæsar separated from
  his government, and added them to the province of Syria.</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>That is to say, Augustus simply restored the state of things which
  existed before he gave Gadara, then certainly a Gentile city, lying
  outside Judæa, to <!-- Page 551 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page551"></a>{551}</span>Herod as a mark of great personal favour.
  Yet Mr. Gladstone can gravely tell those who are not in a position to
  check his statements:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>The sense seems to be not that these cities were inhabited by a Greek
  population, but that they had politically been taken out of Judæa and
  added to Syria, which I presume was classified as simply Hellenic, a
  portion of the great Greek empire erected by Alexander. (Pp. 295-6.)</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>Mr. Gladstone's next reference is to the <i>Wars</i>, III. vii. 1:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>So Vespasian marched to the city Gadara, and took it upon the first
  onset, because he found it destitute of a considerable number of men
  grown up fit for war. He then came into it, and slew all the youth, the
  Romans having no mercy on any age whatsoever; and this was done out of
  the hatred they bore the nation, and because of the iniquity they had
  been guilty of in the affair of Cestius.</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>Obviously, then, Gadara was an ultra-Jewish city. Q.E.D. But a student
  trained in the use of weapons of precision, rather than in that of
  rhetorical tomahawks, has had many and painful warnings to look well
  about him before trusting an argument to the mercies of a passage, the
  context of which he has not carefully considered. If Mr. Gladstone had
  not been too much in a hurry to turn his imaginary prize to
  account&mdash;if he had paused just to look at the preceding chapter of
  Josephus&mdash;he would have discovered that his much haste meant very
  little speed. He would have found (<i>Wars</i>, III. vi. 2) that
  Vespasian marched from his base, the port of Ptolemais (Acre), on the
  shores of the Mediterranean, into Galilee; and, having dealt with the
  so-called "Gadara," was minded <!-- Page 552 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page552"></a>{552}</span>to finish with Jotapata, a strong place
  about fourteen miles south-east of Ptolemais, into which Josephus, who at
  first had fled to Tiberias, eventually threw himself&mdash;Vespasian
  arriving before Jotapata "the very next day." Now, if any one will take a
  decent map of Ancient Palestine in hand, he will see that Jotapata, as I
  have said, lies about fourteen miles in a straight line east-south-east
  of Ptolemais, while a certain town, "Gabara" (which was also held by the
  Jews), is situated about the same distance to the east of that port.
  Nothing can be more obvious than that Vespasian, wishing to advance from
  Ptolemais into Galilee, could not afford to leave these strongholds in
  the possession of the enemy; and as Gabara would lie on his left flank
  when he moved to Jotapata, he took that city, whence his communications
  with his base could easily be threatened, first. It might really have
  been fair evidence of demoniac possession, if the best general of Rome
  had marched forty odd miles, as the crow flies, through hostile Galilee,
  to take a city (which, moreover, had just tried to abolish its Jewish
  population) on the other side of the Jordan; and then marched back again
  to a place fourteen miles off his starting-point.<a name="NtA158"
  href="#Nt158"><sup>[158]</sup></a> One would think that the most careless
  of readers must be startled by this incongruity into inquiring whether
  there might not be something wrong with the text; and if he had done so
  he would <!-- Page 553 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page553"></a>{553}</span>have easily discovered that since the time
  of Reland, a century and a half ago, careful scholars have read
  Ga<i>b</i>ara for Ga<i>d</i>ara.<a name="NtA159"
  href="#Nt159"><sup>[159]</sup></a></p>

  <p>Once more, I venture to point out that training in the use of the
  weapons of precision of science may have its value in historical studies,
  if only in preventing the occurrence of droll blunders in geography.</p>

  <p>In the third citation (<i>Wars</i>, IV. vii.) Josephus tells us that
  Vespasian marched against "Gadara," which he calls the metropolis of
  Peræa (it was possibly the seat of a common festival of the Decapolitan
  cities), and entered it without opposition, the wealthy and powerful
  citizens having opened negotiations with him without the knowledge of an
  opposite party, who, "as being inferior in number to their enemies who
  were within the city, and seeing the Romans very near the city," resolved
  to fly. Before doing so, however, they, after a fashion unfortunately too
  common among the Zealots, murdered and shockingly mutilated Dolesus, a
  man of the first rank, who had promoted the embassy to Vespasian, and
  then "ran out of the city." Hereupon "the people of Gadara" (surely not
  this time "Hebrews bound by the Mosaic law") received Vespasian with
  joyful acclamations, voluntarily pulled down their wall, so that the city
  could not in future be used as a fortress by the Jews, and accepted a
  Roman garrison for their future protection. Granting that this Gadara
  really is the city of the Gadarenes, the reference, without citation, to
  <!-- Page 554 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page554"></a>{554}</span>the passage in support of Mr. Gladstone's
  contention seems rather remarkable. Taken in conjunction with the shortly
  antecedent ravaging of the Gadarene territory by the Jews, in fact,
  better proof could hardly be expected of the real state of the case;
  namely, that the population of Gadara (and notably the wealthy and
  respectable part of it) was thoroughly Hellenic; though, as in Cæsarea
  and elsewhere among the Palestinian cities, the rabble contained a
  considerable body of fanatical Jews, whose reckless ferocity made them,
  even though a mere minority of the population, a standing danger to the
  city.</p>

  <p>Thus Mr. Gladstone's conclusion from his study of Josephus, that the
  population of Gadara were "Hebrews bound by the Mosaic law," turns out to
  depend upon nothing better than a marvellously complete misinterpretation
  of what that author says, combined with equally marvellous geographical
  misunderstandings, long since exposed and rectified; while the positive
  evidence that Gadara, like other cities of the Decapolis, was thoroughly
  Hellenic in organisation and essentially Gentile in population is
  overwhelming.</p>

  <p>And, that being the fact of the matter, patent to all who will take
  the trouble to inquire about what has been said about it, however obscure
  to those who merely talk of so doing, the thesis that the Gadarene
  swineherds, or owners, were Jews violating the Mosaic law shows itself to
  be an empty and most unfortunate guess. But really, whether they that
  kept the swine were Jews, or whether they were Gentiles, is a <!-- Page
  555 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page555"></a>{555}</span>consideration which has no relevance
  whatever to my case. The legal provisions which alone had authority over
  an inhabitant of the country of the Gadarenes were the Gentile laws
  sanctioned by the Roman suzerain of the province of Syria, just as the
  only law which has authority in England is that recognised by the
  sovereign Legislature. Jewish communities in England may have their
  private code, as they doubtless had in Gadara. But an English magistrate,
  if called upon to enforce their peculiar laws, would dismiss the
  complainants from the judgment seat, let us hope with more politeness
  than Gallio did in a like case, but quite as firmly. Moreover, in the
  matter of keeping pigs, we may be quite certain that Gadarene law left
  everybody free to do as he pleased, indeed encouraged the practice rather
  than otherwise. Not only was pork one of the commonest and one of the
  most favourite articles of Roman diet; but, to both Greeks and Romans,
  the pig was a sacrificial animal of high importance. Sucking pigs played
  an important part in Hellenic purificatory rites; and everybody knows the
  significance of the Roman suovetaurilia, depicted on so many
  bas-reliefs.</p>

  <p>Under these circumstances, only the extreme need of a despairing
  "reconciler" drowning in a sea of adverse facts, can explain the catching
  at such a poor straw as the reckless guess that the swineherds of the
  "country of the Gadarenes" were erring Jews, doing a little clandestine
  business on their own account. The endeavour to justify the asserted
  destruction of the swine by the analogy of breaking open a cask of <!--
  Page 556 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page556"></a>{556}</span>smuggled spirits, and wasting their
  contents on the ground, is curiously unfortunate. Does Mr. Gladstone mean
  to suggest that a Frenchman landing at Dover, and coming upon a cask of
  smuggled brandy in the course of a stroll along the cliffs, has the right
  to break it open and waste its contents on the ground? Yet the party of
  Galileans who, according to the narrative, landed and took a walk on the
  Gadarene territory, were as much foreigners in the Decapolis as Frenchmen
  would be at Dover. Herod Antipas, their sovereign, had no jurisdiction in
  the Decapolis&mdash;they were strangers and aliens, with no more right to
  interfere with a pig-keeping Hebrew than I have a right to interfere with
  an English professor of the Israelitic faith, if I see a slice of ham on
  his plate. According to the law of the country in which these Galilean
  foreigners found themselves, men might keep pigs if they pleased. If the
  men who kept them were Jews, it might be permissible for the strangers to
  inform the religious authority acknowledged by the Jews of Gadara, but to
  interfere themselves in such a matter was a step devoid of either moral
  or legal justification.</p>

  <p>Suppose a modern English Sabbatarian fanatic, who believes, on the
  strength of his interpretation of the fourth commandment, that it is a
  deadly sin to work on the "Lord's Day," sees a fellow Puritan yielding to
  the temptation of getting in his harvest on a fine Sunday
  morning&mdash;is the former justified in setting fire to the latter's
  corn? Would not an English court of justice speedily teach him better?
  <!-- Page 557 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page557"></a>{557}</span></p>

  <p>In truth, the government which permits private persons, on any pretext
  (especially pious and patriotic pretexts), to take the law into their own
  hands, fails in the performance of the primary duties of all governments;
  while those who set the example of such acts, or who approve them, or who
  fail to disapprove them, are doing their best to dissolve civil
  society&mdash;they are compassers of illegality and fautors of
  immorality.</p>

  <p>I fully understand that Mr. Gladstone may not see the matter in this
  light. He may possibly consider that the union of Gadara with the
  Decapolis by Augustus was a "blackguard" transaction, which deprived
  Hellenic Gadarene law of all moral force; and that it was quite proper
  for a Jewish Galilean, going back to the time when the land of the
  Girgashites was given to his ancestors, some 1500 years before, to act as
  if the state of things which ought to obtain in territory which
  traditionally, at any rate, belonged to his forefathers, did really
  exist. And, that being so, I can only say I do not agree with him, but
  leave the matter to the appreciation of those of our countrymen, happily
  not yet the minority, who believe that the first condition of enduring
  liberty is obedience to the law of the land.</p>

  <p>&nbsp;</p>

  <p>The end of the month drawing nigh, I thought it well to send away the
  manuscript of the foregoing pages yesterday, leaving open, in my own
  mind, the possibility of adding a succinct characterisation of Mr.
  Gladstone's controversial methods as illustrated <!-- Page 558 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page558"></a>{558}</span>therein. This morning,
  however, I had the pleasure of reading a speech which I think must
  satisfy the requirements of the most fastidious of controversial artists;
  and there occurs in it so concise, yet so complete, a delineation of Mr.
  Gladstone's way of dealing with disputed questions of another kind, that
  no poor effort of mine could better it as a description of the aspect
  which his treatment of scientific, historical, and critical questions
  presents to me.</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>The smallest examination would have told a man of his capacity and of
  his experience that he was uttering the grossest exaggerations, that he
  was basing arguments upon the slightest hypotheses, and that his
  discussions only had to be critically examined by the most careless
  critic in order to show their intrinsic hollowness.</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>Those who have followed me through this paper will hardly dispute the
  justice of this judgment, severe as it is. But the Chief Secretary for
  Ireland has science in the blood; and has the advantage of a natural, as
  well as a highly cultivated, aptitude for the use of methods of precision
  in investigation, and for the exact enunciation of the results thereby
  obtained.</p>

<h3>XV</h3>

<h3>ILLUSTRATIONS OF MR. GLADSTONE'S
CONTROVERSIAL METHODS</h3>

  <p>The series of essays in defence of the historical accuracy of the
  Jewish and Christian Scriptures contributed by Mr. Gladstone to <i>Good
  Words</i>, having been revised and enlarged by their author, appeared
  last year as a separate volume, under the somewhat defiant title of
  <i>The Impregnable Rock of Holy Scripture</i>.</p>

  <p>The last of these essays, entitled "Conclusion," contains an attack,
  or rather several attacks, couched in language which certainly does not
  err upon the side of moderation or of courtesy, upon statements and
  opinions of mine. One of these assaults is a deliberately devised
  attempt, not merely to rouse the theological prejudices ingrained in the
  majority of Mr. Gladstone's readers, but to hold me up as a person who
  has endeavoured to besmirch the personal character of the object of their
  veneration. For Mr. Gladstone asserts that I have undertaken to try "the
  character of our Lord" (p. 268); and he tells the many who are, as I
  think unfortunately, predisposed <!-- Page 560 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page560"></a>{560}</span>to place implicit
  credit in his assertions, that it has been reserved for me to discover
  that Jesus "was no better than a law-breaker and an evil-doer!" (p.
  269).</p>

  <p>It was extremely easy for me to prove, as I did in the pages of this
  Review last December, that, under the most favourable interpretation,
  this amazing declaration must be ascribed to extreme confusion of
  thought. And, by bringing an abundance of good-will to the consideration
  of the subject, I have now convinced myself that it is right for me to
  admit that a person of Mr. Gladstone's intellectual acuteness really did
  mistake the reprobation of the course of conduct ascribed to Jesus, in a
  story of which I expressly say I do not believe a word, for an attack on
  his character and a declaration that he was "no better than a law-breaker
  and evil-doer." At any rate, so far as I can see, this is what Mr.
  Gladstone wished to be believed when he wrote the following
  passage:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>I must, however, in passing, make the confession that I did not state
  with accuracy, as I ought to have done, the precise form of the
  accusation. I treated it as an imputation on the action of our Lord; he
  replies that it is only an imputation on the narrative of three
  evangelists respecting Him. The difference, from his point of view, is
  probably material, and I therefore regret that I overlooked it.<a
  name="NtA160" href="#Nt160"><sup>[160]</sup></a></p>

</blockquote>

  <p>Considering the gravity of the error which is here admitted, the
  fashion of the withdrawal appears more singular than admirable. From my
  "point of view"&mdash;not from Mr. Gladstone's apparently&mdash;the
  little discrepancy between the facts and Mr. Gladstone's <!-- Page 561
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page561"></a>{561}</span>carefully
  offensive travesty of them is "probably" (only "probably") material.
  However, as Mr. Gladstone concludes with an official expression of regret
  for his error, it is my business to return an equally official expression
  of gratitude for the attenuated reparation with which I am favoured.</p>

  <p>Having cleared this specimen of Mr. Gladstone's controversial method
  out of the way, I may proceed to the next assault, that on a passage in
  an article on Agnosticism (<i>Nineteenth Century</i>, February 1889),
  published two years ago. I there said, in referring to the Gadarene
  story, "Everything I know of law and justice convinces me that the wanton
  destruction of other people's property is a misdemeanour of evil
  example." On this, Mr. Gladstone, continuing his candid and urbane
  observations, remarks (<i>Impregnable Rock</i>, p. 273) that, "Exercising
  his rapid judgment on the text," and "not inquiring what anybody else had
  known or said about it," I had missed a point in support of that
  "accusation against our Lord" which he has now been constrained to admit
  I never made.</p>

  <p>The "point" in question is that "Gadara was a city of Greeks rather
  than of Jews, from whence it might be inferred that to keep swine was
  innocent and lawful." I conceive that I have abundantly proved that
  Gadara answered exactly to the description here given of it; and I shall
  show, by-and-by, that Mr. Gladstone has used language which, to my mind,
  involves the admission that the authorities of the city were not Jews.
  But I have also taken a <!-- Page 562 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page562"></a>{562}</span>good deal of pains to show that the
  question thus raised is of no importance in relation to the main issue.<a
  name="NtA161" href="#Nt161"><sup>[161]</sup></a> If Gadara was, as I
  maintain it was, a city of the Decapolis, Hellenistic in constitution and
  containing a predominantly Gentile population, my case is superabundantly
  fortified. On the other hand, if the hypothesis that Gadara was under
  Jewish government, which Mr. Gladstone seems sometimes to defend and
  sometimes to give up, were accepted, my case would be nowise weakened. At
  any rate, Gadara was not included within the jurisdiction of the tetrarch
  of Galilee; if it had been, the Galileans who crossed over the lake to
  Gadara had no official status; and they had no more civil right to punish
  law-breakers than any other strangers.</p>

  <p>In my turn, however, I may remark that there is a "point" which
  appears to have escaped Mr. Gladstone's notice. And that is somewhat
  unfortunate, because his whole argument turns upon it. Mr. Gladstone
  assumes, as a matter of course, that pig-keeping was an offence against
  the "Law of Moses"; and, therefore, that Jews who kept pigs were as much
  liable to legal pains and penalties <!-- Page 563 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page563"></a>{563}</span>as Englishmen who
  smuggle brandy (<i>Impregnable Rock</i>, p. 274).</p>

  <p>There can be no doubt that, according to the Law, as it is defined in
  the Pentateuch, the pig was an "unclean" animal, and that pork was a
  forbidden article of diet. Moreover, since pigs are hardly likely to be
  kept for the mere love of those unsavoury animals, pig-owning, or
  swine-herding, must have been, and evidently was, regarded as a
  suspicious and degrading occupation by strict Jews, in the first century
  <span class="scac">A.D.</span> But I should like to know on what
  provision of the Mosaic Law, as it is laid down in the Pentateuch, Mr.
  Gladstone bases the assumption, which is essential to his case, that the
  possession of pigs and the calling of a swineherd were actually illegal.
  The inquiry was put to me the other day; and, as I could not answer it, I
  turned up the article "Schwein " in Riehm's standard
  <i>Handwörterbuch</i>, for help out of my difficulty; but unfortunately
  without success. After speaking of the martyrdom which the Jews, under
  Antiochus Epiphanes, preferred to eating pork, the writer
  proceeds:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>It may be, nevertheless, that the practice of keeping pigs may have
  found its way into Palestine in the Græco-Roman time, in consequence of
  the great increase of the non-Jewish population; yet there is no evidence
  of it in the New Testament; the great herd of swine, 2000 in number,
  mentioned in the narrative of the possessed, was feeding in the territory
  of Gadara, which belonged to the Decapolis; and the prodigal son became a
  swineherd with the native of a far country into which he had wandered; in
  neither of these cases is there <!-- Page 564 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page564"></a>{564}</span>reason for thinking that the possessors of
  these herds were Jews.<a name="NtA162"
  href="#Nt162"><sup>[162]</sup></a></p>

</blockquote>

  <p>Having failed in my search, so far, I took up the next work of
  reference at hand, Kitto's <i>Cyclopædia</i> (vol. iii. 1876). There,
  under "Swine," the writer, Colonel Hamilton Smith, seemed at first to
  give me what I wanted, as he says that swine "appear to have been
  repeatedly introduced and reared by the Hebrew people,<a name="NtA163"
  href="#Nt163"><sup>[163]</sup></a> notwithstanding the strong prohibition
  in the Law of Moses (Is. lxv. 4)." But, in the first place, Isaiah's
  writings form no part of the "Law of Moses"; and, in the second place,
  the people denounced by the prophet in this passage are neither the
  possessors of pigs, nor swineherds, but those "which eat swine's flesh
  and broth of abominable things is in their vessels." And when, in
  despair, I turned to the provisions of the Law itself, my difficulty was
  not cleared up. Leviticus xi. 8 (Revised Version) says, in reference to
  the pig and other unclean animals: "Of their flesh ye shall not eat, and
  their carcases ye shall not touch." In the revised version of Deuteronomy
  xiv. 8 the words of the prohibition are identical, and a skilful refiner
  might possibly satisfy himself, even if he satisfied nobody else, that
  "carcase" means the body of a live <!-- Page 565 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page565"></a>{565}</span>animal as well as of a
  dead one; and that, since swineherds could hardly avoid contact with
  their charges, their calling was implicitly forbidden.<a name="NtA164"
  href="#Nt164"><sup>[164]</sup></a> Unfortunately, the authorised version
  expressly says "dead carcase"; and thus the most rabbinically minded of
  reconcilers might find his casuistry foiled by that great source of
  surprises, the "original Hebrew." That such check is at any rate
  possible, is clear from the fact that the legal uncleanness of some
  animals, as food, did not interfere with their being lawfully possessed,
  cared for, and sold by Jews. The provisions for the ransoming of unclean
  beasts (Lev. xxvii. 27) and for the redemption of their sucklings
  (Numbers xviii. 15) sufficiently prove this. As the late Dr. Kalisch has
  observed in his <i>Commentary on Leviticus</i>, part ii. p. 129,
  note:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>Though asses and horses, camels and dogs, were kept by the Israelites,
  they were, to a certain extent, associated with the notion of impurity;
  they might be turned to profitable account by their labour or otherwise,
  but in respect to food they were an abomination.</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>The same learned commentator (<i>loc. cit.</i> p. 88) proves that the
  Talmudists forbade the rearing of pigs by Jews, unconditionally and
  everywhere; and even included it under the same ban as the study of Greek
  philosophy, "since both alike were considered to lead to the desertion of
  the Jewish faith." It is very possible, indeed probable, that the
  Pharisees of the fourth decade of our first century took as <!-- Page 566
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page566"></a>{566}</span>strong a view
  of pig-keeping as did their spiritual descendants. But, for all that, it
  does not follow that the practice was illegal. The stricter Jews could
  not have despised and hated swineherds more than they did publicans; but,
  so far as I know, there is no provision in the Law against the practice
  of the calling of a tax-gatherer by a Jew. The publican was in fact very
  much in the position of an Irish process-server at the present
  day&mdash;more, rather than less, despised and hated on account of the
  perfect legality of his occupation. Except for certain sacrificial
  purposes, pigs were held in such abhorrence by the ancient Egyptians that
  swineherds were not permitted to enter a temple, or to intermarry with
  other castes; and any one who had touched a pig, even accidentally, was
  unclean. But these very regulations prove that pig-keeping was not
  illegal; it merely involved certain civil and religious disabilities. For
  the Jews, dogs were typically "unclean" animals; but, when that eminently
  pious Hebrew, Tobit, "went forth" with the angel "the young man's dog"
  went "with them" (Tobit v. 16) without apparent remonstrance from the
  celestial guide. I really do not see how an appeal to the Law could have
  justified any one in drowning Tobit's dog, on the ground that his master
  was keeping and feeding an animal quite as "unclean" as any pig.
  Certainly the excellent Raguel must have failed to see the harm of
  dog-keeping, for we are told that, on the travellers' return homewards,
  "the dog went after them" (xi. 4). <!-- Page 567 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page567"></a>{567}</span></p>

  <p>Until better light than I have been able to obtain is thrown upon the
  subject, therefore, it is obvious that Mr. Gladstone's argumentative
  house has been built upon an extremely slippery quicksand; perhaps even
  has no foundation at all.</p>

  <p>Yet another "point" does not seem to have occurred to Mr. Gladstone,
  who is so much shocked that I attach no overwhelming weight to the
  assertions contained in the synoptic Gospels, even when all three concur.
  These Gospels agree in stating, in the most express, and to some extent
  verbally identical, terms, that the devils entered the pigs at their own
  request,<a name="NtA165" href="#Nt165"><sup>[165]</sup></a> and the third
  Gospel (viii. 31) tells us what the motive of the demons was in asking
  the singular boon: "They intreated him that he would not command them to
  depart into the abyss." From this, it would seem that the devils thought
  to exchange the heavy punishment of transportation to the abyss for the
  lighter penalty of imprisonment in swine. And some commentators, more
  ingenious than respectful to the supposed chief actor in this
  extraordinary fable, have dwelt, with satisfaction, upon the very
  unpleasant quarter of an hour which the evil spirits must have had, when
  the headlong rush of their maddened tenements convinced them how
  completely they were taken in. In the whole story there is not one
  solitary hint that the destruction of <!-- Page 568 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page568"></a>{568}</span>the pigs was intended
  as a punishment of their owners, or of the swineherds. On the contrary,
  the concurrent testimony of the three narratives is to the effect that
  the catastrophe was the consequence of diabolic suggestion. And, indeed,
  no source could be more appropriate for an act of such manifest injustice
  and illegality.</p>

  <p>I can but marvel that modern defenders of the faith should not be glad
  of any reasonable excuse for getting rid of a story which, if it had been
  invented by Voltaire, would have justly let loose floods of orthodox
  indignation.</p>

  <p>&nbsp;</p>

  <p>Thus, the hypothesis to which Mr. Gladstone so fondly clings finds no
  support in the provisions of the "Law of Moses" as that law is defined in
  the Pentateuch; while it is wholly inconsistent with the concurrent
  testimony of the synoptic Gospels, to which Mr. Gladstone attaches so
  much weight. In my judgment, it is directly contrary to everything which
  profane history tells us about the constitution and the population of the
  city of Gadara; and it commits those who accept it to a story which, if
  it were true, would implicate the founder of Christianity in an illegal
  and inequitable act.</p>

  <p>Such being the case, I consider myself excused from following Mr.
  Gladstone through all the meanderings of his late attempt to extricate
  himself from the maze of historical and exegetical difficulties in which
  he is entangled. I content myself with assuring those who, with my paper
  (not Mr. Gladstone's <!-- Page 569 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page569"></a>{569}</span>version of my arguments) in hand, consult
  the original authorities, that they will find full justification for
  every statement I have made. But in order to dispose those who cannot, or
  will not, take that trouble, to believe that the proverbial blindness of
  one that judges his own cause plays no part in inducing me to speak thus
  decidedly, I beg their attention to the following examination, which
  shall be as brief as I can make it, of the seven propositions in which
  Mr. Gladstone professes to give a faithful summary of my "errors."</p>

  <p>When, in the middle of the seventeenth century, the Holy See declared
  that certain propositions contained in the works of Bishop Jansen were
  heretical, the Jansenists of Port Royal replied that, while they were
  ready to defer to the Papal authority about questions of faith and
  morals, they must be permitted to judge about questions of fact for
  themselves; and that, really, the condemned propositions were not to be
  found in Jansen's writings. As everybody knows, His Holiness and the
  Grand Monarque replied to this, surely not unreasonable, plea after the
  manner of Lord Peter in the <i>Tale of a Tub</i>. It is, therefore, not
  without some apprehension of meeting with a similar fate, that I put in a
  like plea against Mr. Gladstone's Bull. The seven propositions declared
  to be false and condemnable, in that kindly and gentle way which so
  pleasantly compares with the authoritative style of the Vatican (No. 5
  more particularly), may or may not be true. But they are not to be found
  in anything I have written. <!-- Page 570 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page570"></a>{570}</span>And some of them diametrically contravene
  that which I have written. I proceed to prove my assertions.</p>

  <p><span class="sc">Prop.</span> 1. <i>Throughout the paper he confounds
  together what I had distinguished, namely, the city of Gadara and the
  vicinage attached to it, not as a mere pom&oelig;rium, but as a rural
  district.</i></p>

  <p>In my judgment, this statement is devoid of foundation. In my paper on
  "The Keepers of the Herd of Swine" I point out, at some length, that, "in
  accordance with the ancient Hellenic practice," each city of the
  Decapolis must have been "surrounded by a certain amount of territory
  amenable to its jurisdiction:" and, to enforce this conclusion, I quote
  what Josephus says about the "villages that belonged to Gadara and
  Hippos." As I understand the term <i>pomerium</i> or
  <i>pom&oelig;rium</i>,<a name="NtA166" href="#Nt166"><sup>[166]</sup></a>
  it means the space which, according to Roman custom, was kept free from
  buildings, immediately within and without the walls of a city; and which
  defined the range of the <i>auspicia urbana</i>. The conception of a
  <i>pom&oelig;rium</i> as a "vicinage attached to" a city, appears to be
  something quite novel and original. But then, to be sure, I do not know
  how many senses Mr. Gladstone may attach to the word "vicinage."</p>

  <p>Whether Gadara had a <i>pom&oelig;rium</i>, in the proper technical
  sense, or not, is a point on which I offer no opinion. But that the city
  had a very considerable "rural district" attached to it and,
  notwithstanding <!-- Page 571 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page571"></a>{571}</span>its distinctness, amenable to the
  jurisdiction of the Gentile municipal authorities, is one of the main
  points of my case.</p>

  <p><span class="sc">Prop.</span> 2. <i>He more fatally confounds the
  local civil government and its following, including, perhaps, the whole
  wealthy class and those attached to it, with the ethnical character of
  the general population.</i></p>

  <p>Having survived confusion No. 1, which turns out not to be on my side,
  I am now confronted in No. 2 with a "more fatal" error&mdash;and so it
  is, if there be degrees of fatality; but, again, it is Mr. Gladstone's
  and not mine. It would appear, from this proposition (about the
  grammatical interpretation of which, however, I admit there are
  difficulties), that Mr. Gladstone holds that the "local civil government
  and its following among the wealthy," were ethnically different from the
  "general population." On p. 348 he further admits that the "wealthy and
  the local governing power" were friendly to the Romans. Are we then to
  suppose that it was the persons of Jewish "ethnical character" who
  favoured the Romans, while those of Gentile "ethnical character" were
  opposed to them? But if that supposition is absurd, the only alternative
  is that the local civil government was ethnically Gentile. This is
  exactly my contention.</p>

  <p>At pp. 547 and 553 of the Essay on "The Keepers of the Herd of Swine"
  I have fully discussed the question of the ethnical character of the
  general population. I have shown that, according to Josephus, who surely
  ought to have known, Gadara was as much a Gentile <!-- Page 572 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page572"></a>{572}</span>city as Ptolemais; I
  have proved that he includes Gadara amongst the cities "that rose up
  against the Jews that were amongst them," which is a pretty definite
  expression of his belief that the "ethnical character of the general
  population" was Gentile. There is no question here of Jews of the Roman
  party fighting with Jews of the Zealot party, as Mr. Gladstone suggests.
  It is the non-Jewish and anti-Jewish general population which rises up
  against the Jews who had settled "among them."</p>

  <p><span class="sc">Prop.</span> 3. <i>His one item of direct evidence as
  to the Gentile character of the city refers only to the former and not to
  the latter.</i></p>

  <p>More fatal still. But, once more, not to me. I adduce not one, but a
  variety of "items" in proof of the non-Judaic character of the population
  of Gadara: the evidence of history; that of the coinage of the city; the
  direct testimony of Josephus, just cited&mdash;to mention no others. I
  repeat, if the wealthy people and those connected with them&mdash;the
  "classes" and the "hangers on" of Mr. Gladstone's well-known
  taxonomy&mdash;were, as he appears to admit they were, Gentiles; if the
  "civil government" of the city was in their hands, as the coinage proves
  it was; what becomes of Mr. Gladstone's original proposition in <i>The
  Impregnable Rock of Scripture</i> that "the population of Gadara, and
  still less (if less may be) the population of the neighbourhood," were
  "Hebrews bound by the Mosaic law"? And what is the importance of
  estimating the precise proportion of Hebrews who may have resided, either
  in the city of Gadara <!-- Page 573 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page573"></a>{573}</span>or in its dependant territory, when, as
  Mr. Gladstone now seems to admit (I am careful to say "seems"), the
  government, and consequently the law, which ruled in that territory and
  defined civil right and wrong was Gentile and not Judaic? But perhaps Mr.
  Gladstone is prepared to maintain that the Gentile "local civil
  government" of a city of the Decapolis administered Jewish Law; and
  showed their respect for it, more particularly, by stamping their coinage
  with effigies of the Emperors.</p>

  <p>In point of fact, in his haste to attribute to me errors which I have
  not committed, Mr. Gladstone has given away his case.</p>

  <p><span class="sc">Prop.</span> 4. <i>He fatally confounds the question
  of political party with those of nationality and of religion, and assumes
  that those who took the side of Rome in the factions that prevailed could
  not be subject to the Mosaic Law.</i></p>

  <p>It would seem that I have a feline tenacity of life; once more, a
  "fatal error." But Mr. Gladstone has forgotten an excellent rule of
  controversy; say what is true, of course, but mind that it is decently
  probable. Now it is not decently probable, hardly indeed conceivable,
  that any one who has read Josephus, or any other historian of the Jewish
  war, should be unaware that there were Jews (of whom Josephus himself was
  one) who "Romanised" and, more or less openly, opposed the war party.
  But, however that may be, I assert that Mr. Gladstone neither has
  produced, nor can produce, a passage of my writing which affords the
  slightest <!-- Page 574 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page574"></a>{574}</span>foundation for this particular article of
  his indictment.</p>

  <p><span class="sc">Prop.</span> 5. <i>His examination of the text of
  Josephus is alike one-sided, inadequate, and erroneous.</i></p>

  <p>Easy to say, hard to prove. So long as the authorities whom I have
  cited are on my side, I do not know why this singularly temperate and
  convincing dictum should trouble me. I have yet to become acquainted with
  Mr. Gladstone's claims to speak with an authority equal to that of
  scholars of the rank of Schürer, whose obviously just and necessary
  emendations he so unceremoniously pooh-poohs.</p>

  <p><span class="sc">Prop.</span> 6. <i>Finally, he sets aside, on grounds
  not critical or historical, but partly subjective, the primary historical
  testimony on the subject, namely, that of the three Synoptic Evangelists,
  who write as contemporaries and deal directly with the subject, neither
  of which is done by any other authority.</i></p>

  <p>Really this is too much! The fact is, as anybody can see who will turn
  to my article of February 1889, out of which all this discussion has
  arisen, that the arguments upon which I rest the strength of my case
  touching the swine-miracle, are exactly "historical" and "critical."
  Expressly, and in words that cannot be misunderstood, I refuse to rest on
  what Mr. Gladstone calls "subjective" evidence. I abstain from denying
  the possibility of the Gadarene occurrence, and I even go so far as to
  speak of some physical analogies to possession. In fact, my quondam
  opponent, Dr. Wace, shrewdly, but quite fairly, made the most of these
  admissions, and stated that I had <!-- Page 575 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page575"></a>{575}</span>removed the only
  "consideration which would have been a serious obstacle" in the way of
  his belief in the Gadarene story.<a name="NtA167"
  href="#Nt167"><sup>[167]</sup></a></p>

  <p>So far from setting aside the authority of the synoptics on
  "subjective" grounds, I have taken a great deal of trouble to show that
  my non-belief in the story is based upon what appears to me to be
  evident; firstly, that the accounts of the three synoptic Gospels are not
  independent, but are founded upon a common source; secondly, that, even
  if the story of the common tradition proceeded from a contemporary, it
  would still be worthy of very little credit, seeing the manner in which
  the legends about mediæval miracles have been propounded by
  contemporaries. And in illustration of this position I wrote a special
  essay about the miracles reported by Eginhard.<a name="NtA168"
  href="#Nt168"><sup>[168]</sup></a></p>

  <p>In truth, one need go no further than Mr. Gladstone's sixth
  proposition to be convinced that contemporary testimony, even of
  well-known and distinguished persons, may be but a very frail reed for
  the support of the historian, when theological prepossession blinds the
  witness.<a name="NtA169" href="#Nt169"><sup>[169]</sup></a></p>

<p><!-- Page 576 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page576"></a>{576}</span></p>

  <p><span class="sc">Prop.</span> 7. <i>And he treats the entire question,
  in the narrowed form in which it arises upon secular testimony, as if it
  were capable of a solution so clear and summary as to warrant the use of
  the extremest weapons of controversy against those who presume to differ
  from him.</i></p>

  <p>The six heretical propositions which have gone before are enunciated
  with sufficient clearness to enable me to prove without any difficulty
  that, whosesoever they are, they are not mine. But number seven, I
  confess, is too hard for me. I cannot undertake to contradict that which
  I do not understand.</p>

  <p>What is the "entire question" which "arises" in a "narrowed form" upon
  "secular testimony"? After much guessing, I am fain to give up the
  conundrum. The "question" may be the ownership of the pigs; or the
  ethnological character of the <!-- Page 577 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page577"></a>{577}</span>Gadarenes; or the propriety of meddling
  with other people's property without legal warrant. And each of these
  questions might be so "narrowed" when it arose on "secular testimony"
  that I should not know where I was. So I am silent on this part of the
  proposition.</p>

  <p>But I do dimly discern in the latter moiety of this mysterious
  paragraph a reproof of that use of "the extremest weapons of controversy"
  which is attributed to me. Upon which I have to observe that I guide
  myself in such matters very much by the maxim of a great statesman, "Do
  ut des." If Mr. Gladstone objects to the employment of such weapons in
  defence, he would do well to abstain from them in attack. He should not
  frame charges which he has, afterwards, to admit are erroneous, in
  language of carefully calculated offensiveness (<i>Impregnable Rock</i>,
  pp. 269-70); he should not assume that persons with whom he disagrees are
  so recklessly unconscientious as to evade the trouble of inquiring what
  has been said or known about a grave question (<i>Impregnable Rock</i>,
  p. 273); he should not qualify the results of careful thought as
  "hand-over-head reasoning" (<i>Impregnable Rock</i>, p. 274); he should
  not, as in the extraordinary propositions which I have just analysed,
  make assertions respecting his opponent's position and arguments which
  are contradicted by the plainest facts.</p>

  <p>Persons who, like myself, having spent their lives outside the
  political world, yet take a mild and philosophical concern in what goes
  on in it, often find <!-- Page 578 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page578"></a>{578}</span>it difficult to understand what our
  neighbours call the psychological moment of this or that party leader and
  are, occasionally, loth to believe in the seeming conditions of certain
  kinds of success. And when some chieftain, famous in political warfare,
  adventures into the region of letters or of science, in full confidence
  that the methods which have brought fame and honour in his own province
  will answer there, he is apt to forget that he will be judged by these
  people, on whom rhetorical artifices have long ceased to take effect; and
  to whom mere dexterity in putting together cleverly ambiguous phrases,
  and even the great art of offensive misrepresentation, are unspeakably
  wearisome. And, if that weariness finds its expression in sarcasm, the
  offender really has no right to cry out. Assuredly, ridicule is no test
  of truth, but it is the righteous meed of some kinds of error. Nor ought
  the attempt to confound the expression of a revolted sense of fair
  dealing with arrogant impatience of contradiction, to restrain those to
  whom "the extreme weapons of controversy" come handy from using them. The
  function of police in the intellectual, if not in the civil, economy may
  sometimes be legitimately discharged by volunteers.</p>

  <p>&nbsp;</p>

  <p>Some time ago, in one of the many criticisms with which I am favoured,
  I met with the remark that, at our time of life, Mr. Gladstone and I
  might be better occupied than in fighting over the Gadarene pigs. And, if
  these too famous swine were the only parties to the suit, I, for my part,
  should fully admit the <!-- Page 579 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page579"></a>{579}</span>justice of the rebuke. But, under the
  beneficent rule of the Court of Chancery, in former times, it was not
  uncommon that a quarrel about a few perches of worthless land ended in
  the ruin of ancient families and the engulfing of great estates; and I
  think that our admonisher failed to observe the analogy&mdash;to note the
  momentous consequences of the judgment which may be awarded in the
  present apparently insignificant action <i>in re</i> the swineherds of
  Gadara.</p>

  <p>The immediate effect of such judgment will be the decision of the
  question whether the men of the nineteenth century are to adopt the
  demonology of the men of the first century as divinely revealed truth, or
  to reject it as degrading falsity. The reverend Principal of King's
  College has delivered his judgment in perfectly clear and candid terms.
  Two years since, Dr. Wace said that he believed the story as it stands;
  and consequently he holds, as a part of divine revelation, that the
  spiritual world comprises devils, who, under certain circumstances, may
  enter men and be transferred from them to four-footed beasts. For the
  distinguished Anglican divine and Biblical scholar that is part and
  parcel of the teachings respecting the spiritual world which we owe to
  the founder of Christianity. It is an inseparable part of that Christian
  orthodoxy which, if a man rejects, he is to be considered and called an
  "infidel." According to the ordinary rules of interpretation of language,
  Mr. Gladstone must hold the same view.</p>

  <p>If antiquity and universality are valid tests of the truth of any
  belief, no doubt this is one of the beliefs <!-- Page 580 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page580"></a>{580}</span>so certified. There are
  no known savages, nor people sunk in the ignorance of partial
  civilisation, who do not hold them. The great majority of Christians have
  held them and still hold them. Moreover, the oldest records we possess of
  the early conceptions of mankind in Egypt and in Mesopotamia prove that
  exactly such demonology, as is implied in the Gadarene story, formed the
  substratum, and, among the early Accadians, apparently the greater part,
  of their supposed knowledge of the spiritual world. M. Lenormant's
  profoundly interesting work on Babylonian magic and the magical texts
  given in the Appendix to Professor Sayce's <i>Hibbert Lectures</i> leave
  no doubt on this head. They prove that the doctrine of possession, and
  even the particular case of pig possession,<a name="NtA170"
  href="#Nt170"><sup>[170]</sup></a> were firmly believed in by the
  Egyptians and the Mesopotamians before the tribes of Israel invaded
  Palestine. And it is evident that these beliefs, from some time after the
  exile and probably much earlier, completely interpenetrated the Jewish
  mind, and thus became inseparably interwoven with the fabric of the
  synoptic Gospels.</p>

  <p>Therefore, behind the question of the acceptance of the doctrines of
  the oldest heathen demonology as part of the fundamental beliefs of
  Christianity, there lies the question of the credibility of the Gospels,
  and of their claim to act as our instructors, outside that ethical <!--
  Page 581 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page581"></a>{581}</span>province in which they appeal to the
  consciousness of all thoughtful men. And still, behind this problem,
  there lies another&mdash;how far do these ancient records give a sure
  foundation to the prodigious fabric of Christian dogma which has been
  built upon them by the continuous labours of speculative theologians
  during eighteen centuries?</p>

  <p>I submit that there are few questions before the men of the rising
  generation on the answer to which the future hangs more fatally than
  this. We are at the parting of the ways. Whether the twentieth century
  shall see a recrudescence of the superstitions of mediæval papistry, or
  whether it shall witness the severance of the living body of the ethical
  ideal of prophetic Israel from the carcase, foul with savage
  superstitions and cankered with false philosophy, to which the
  theologians have bound it, turns upon their final judgment of the
  Gadarene tale.</p>

  <p>&nbsp;</p>

  <p>The gravity of the problems ultimately involved in the discussion of
  the legend of Gadara will, I hope, excuse a persistence in returning to
  the subject, to which I should not have been moved by merely personal
  considerations.</p>

  <p>&nbsp;</p>

  <p>With respect to the diluvial invective which overflowed thirty-three
  pages of this Review last January, I doubt not that it has a catastrophic
  importance in the estimation of its author. I, on the other hand, may be
  permitted to regard it as a mere spate; noisy and threatening while it
  lasted, but forgotten almost <!-- Page 582 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page582"></a>{582}</span>as soon as it was over. Without my help,
  it will be judged by every instructed and clear-headed reader; and that
  is fortunate, because, were aid necessary, I have cogent reasons for
  withholding it.</p>

  <p>In an article characterised by the same qualities of thought and
  diction, entitled "A Great Lesson," which appeared in this Review for
  September 1887, the Duke of Argyll, firstly, charged the whole body of
  men of science interested in the question with having conspired to ignore
  certain criticisms of Mr. Darwin's theory of the origin and coral reefs;
  and, secondly, he asserted that some person unnamed had "actually
  induced" Mr. John Murray to delay the publication of his views on that
  subject "for two years."</p>

  <p>It was easy for me and for others to prove that the first statement
  was not only, to use the Duke of Argyll's favourite expression, "contrary
  to fact," but that it was without any foundation whatever. The second
  statement rested on the Duke of Argyll's personal authority. All I could
  do was to demand the production of the evidence for it. Up to the present
  time, so far as I know, that evidence has not made its appearance; nor
  has there been any withdrawal of, or apology for, the erroneous
  charge.</p>

  <p>Under these circumstances, most people will understand why the Duke of
  Argyll may feel quite secure of having the battle all to himself,
  whenever it pleases him to attack me.</p>

<h3>HASISADRA'S ADVENTURE</h3>

  <p>Some thousands of years ago, there was a city in Mesopotamia called
  Surippak. One night a strange dream came to a dweller therein, whose
  name, if rightly reported, was Hasisadra. The dream foretold the speedy
  coming of a great flood; and it warned Hasisadra to lose no time in
  building a ship, in which, when notice was given, he, his family and
  friends, with their domestic animals and a collection of the wild
  creatures and seed of plants of the land, might take refuge and be
  rescued from destruction. Hasisadra awoke, and at once acted upon the
  warning. A strong decked ship was built, and her sides were paid, inside
  and out, with the mineral pitch, or bitumen, with which the country
  abounded; the vessel's seaworthiness was tested, the cargo was stowed
  away, and a trusty pilot or steersman appointed.</p>

  <p>The promised signal arrived. Wife and friends embarked; Hasisadra,
  following, prudently "shut the door," or, as we should say, put on the
  hatches; and Nes-Hea, the pilot, was left alone on deck to do <!-- Page
  584 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page584"></a>{584}</span>his best
  for the ship. Thereupon a hurricane began to rage; rain fell in torrents;
  the subterranean waters burst forth; a deluge swept over the land, and
  the wind lashed it into waves sky high; heaven and earth became mingled
  in chaotic gloom. For six days and seven nights the gale raged, but the
  good ship held out until, on the seventh day, the storm lulled. Hasisadra
  ventured on deck; and, seeing nothing but a waste of waters strewed with
  floating corpses and wreck, wept over the destruction of his land and
  people. Far away, the mountains of Nizir were visible; the ship was
  steered for them and ran aground upon the higher land. Yet another seven
  days passed by. On the seventh, Hasisadra sent forth a dove, which found
  no resting place and returned; then he liberated a swallow, which also
  came back; finally, a raven was let loose, and that sagacious bird, when
  it found that the water had abated, came near the ship, but refused to
  return to it. Upon this, Hasisadra liberated the rest of the wild
  animals, which immediately dispersed in all directions, while he, with
  his family and friends, ascending a mountain hard by, offered sacrifices
  upon its summit to the gods.</p>

  <p>&nbsp;</p>

  <p>The story thus given in summary abstract, told in an ancient Semitic
  dialect, is inscribed in cuneiform characters upon a tablet of burnt
  clay. Many thousands of such tablets, collected by Assurbanipal, King of
  Assyria in the middle of the seventh century <span
  class="scac">B.C.</span>, were stored in the library of his palace at
  <!-- Page 585 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page585"></a>{585}</span>Nineveh; and, though in a sadly broken and
  mutilated condition, they have yielded a marvellous amount of information
  to the patient and sagacious labour which modern scholars have bestowed
  upon them. Among the multitude of documents of various kinds, this
  narrative of Hasisadra's adventure has been found in a tolerably complete
  state. But Assyriologists agree that it is only a copy of a much more
  ancient work; and there are weighty reasons for believing that the story
  of Hasisadra's flood was well known in Mesopotamia before the year 2000
  <span class="scac">B.C.</span></p>

  <p>No doubt, then, we are in presence of a narrative which has all the
  authority which antiquity can confer; and it is proper to deal
  respectfully with it, even though it is quite as proper, and indeed
  necessary, to act no less respectfully towards ourselves; and, before
  professing to put implicit faith in it, to inquire what claim it has to
  be regarded as a serious account of an historical event.</p>

  <p>It is of no use to appeal to contemporary history, although the annals
  of Babylonia, no less than those of Egypt, go much further back than 2000
  <span class="scac">B.C.</span> All that can be said is, that the former
  are hardly consistent with the supposition that any catastrophe,
  competent to destroy all the population, has befallen the land since
  civilisation began, and that the latter are notoriously silent about
  deluges. In such a case as this, however, the silence of history does not
  leave the inquirer wholly at fault. Natural science has something to say
  when the phenomena of nature <!-- Page 586 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page586"></a>{586}</span>are in question. Natural science may be
  able to show, from the nature of the country, either that such an event
  as that described in the story is impossible, or at any rate highly
  improbable; or, on the other hand, that it is consonant with probability.
  In the former case, the narrative must be suspected or rejected; in the
  latter, no such summary verdict can be given: on the contrary, it must be
  admitted that the story may be true. And then, if certain strangely
  prevalent canons of criticism are accepted, and if the evidence that an
  event might have happened is to be accepted as proof that it did happen,
  Assyriologists will be at liberty to congratulate one another on the
  "confirmation by modern science" of the authority of their ancient
  books.</p>

  <p>It will be interesting, therefore, to inquire how far the physical
  structure and the other conditions of the region in which Surippak was
  situated are compatible with such a flood as is described in the Assyrian
  record.</p>

  <p>The scene of Hasisadra's adventure is laid in the broad valley, six or
  seven hundred miles long, and hardly anywhere less than a hundred miles
  in width, which is traversed by the lower courses of the rivers Euphrates
  and Tigris, and which is commonly known as the "Euphrates valley."
  Rising, at the one end, into a hill country, which gradually passes into
  the Alpine heights of Armenia; and, at the other, dipping beneath the
  shallow waters of the head of the Persian Gulf, which continues in the
  same direction, from north-west to south-east, for some eight hundred
  <!-- Page 587 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page587"></a>{587}</span>miles farther, the floor of the valley
  presents a gradual slope, from eight hundred feet above the sea level to
  the depths of the southern end of the Persian Gulf. The boundary between
  sea and land, formed by the extremest mudflats of the delta of the two
  rivers, is but vaguely defined; and, year by year, it advances seaward.
  On the north-eastern side, the western frontier ranges of Persia rise
  abruptly to great heights; on the south-western side, a more gradual
  ascent leads to a table-land of less elevation, which, very broad in the
  south, where it is occupied by the deserts of Arabia and of Southern
  Syria, narrows, northwards, into the highlands of Palestine, and is
  continued by the ranges of the Lebanon, the Antilebanon, and the Taurus,
  into the highlands of Armenia.</p>

  <p>The wide and gently inclined plain, thus inclosed between the gulf and
  the highlands, on each side and at its upper extremity, is
  distinguishable into two regions of very different character, one of
  which lies north, and the other south of the parallel of Hit, on the
  Euphrates. Except in the immediate vicinity of the river, the northern
  division is stony and scantily covered with vegetation, except in spring.
  Over the southern division, on the contrary, spreads a deep alluvial
  soil, in which even a pebble is rare; and which, though, under the
  existing misrule, mainly a waste of marsh and wilderness, needs only
  intelligent attention to become, as it was of old, the granary of western
  Asia. Except in the extreme south, the rainfall is small and the air dry.
  The heat in summer is intense, while bitterly cold northern blasts <!--
  Page 588 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page588"></a>{588}</span>sweep
  the plain in winter. Whirlwinds are not uncommon; and, in the intervals
  of the periodical inundations, the fine, dry, powdery soil is swept, even
  by moderate breezes, into stifling clouds, or rather fogs, of dust. Low
  inequalities, elevations here and depressions there, diversify the
  surface of the alluvial region. The latter are occupied by enormous
  marshes, while the former support the permanent dwellings of the present
  scanty and miserable population.</p>

  <p>In antiquity, so long as the canalisation of the country was properly
  carried out, the fertility of the alluvial plain enabled great and
  prosperous nations to have their home in the Euphrates valley. Its
  abundant clay furnished the materials for the masses of sun-dried and
  burnt bricks, the remains of which, in the shape of huge artificial
  mounds, still testify to both the magnitude and the industry of the
  population, thousands of years ago. Good cement is plentiful, while the
  bitumen, which wells from the rocks at Hit and elsewhere, not only
  answers the same purpose, but is used to this day, as it was in
  Hasisadra's time, to pay the inside and the outside of boats.</p>

  <p>In the broad lower course of the Euphrates, the stream rarely acquires
  a velocity of more than three miles an hour, while the lower Tigris
  attains double that rate in times of flood. The water of both great
  rivers is mainly derived from the northern and eastern highlands in
  Armenia and in Kurdistan, and stands at its lowest level in early autumn
  and in January. <!-- Page 589 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page589"></a>{589}</span>But when the snows accumulated in the
  upper basins of the great rivers, during the winter, melt under the hot
  sunshine of spring, they rapidly rise,<a name="NtA171"
  href="#Nt171"><sup>[171]</sup></a> and at length overflow their banks,
  covering the alluvial plain with a vast inland sea, interrupted only by
  the higher ridges and hummocks which form islands in a seemingly
  boundless expanse of water.</p>

  <p>In the occurrence of these annual inundations lies one of several
  resemblances between the valley of the Euphrates and that of the Nile.
  But there are important differences. The time of the annual flood is
  reversed, the Nile being highest in autumn and winter, and lowest in
  spring and early summer. The periodical overflows of the Nile, regulated
  by the great lake basins in the south, are usually punctual in arrival,
  gradual in growth, and beneficial in operation. No lakes are interposed
  between the mountain torrents of the upper basis of the Tigris and the
  Euphrates and their lower courses. Hence, heavy rain, or an unusually
  rapid thaw in the uplands, gives rise to the sudden irruption of a vast
  volume of water which not even the rapid Tigris, still less its more
  sluggish companion, can carry off in time to prevent violent and
  dangerous overflows. Without an elaborate system of canalisation,
  providing an escape for such sudden excesses of the supply of water, the
  annual floods of the Euphrates, and especially of the <!-- Page 590
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page590"></a>{590}</span>Tigris, must
  always be attended with risk, and often prove harmful.</p>

  <p>There are other peculiarities of the Euphrates valley which may
  occasionally tend to exacerbate the evils attendant on the inundations.
  It is very subject to seismic disturbances; and the ordinary consequences
  of a sharp earthquake shock might be seriously complicated by its effect
  on a broad sheet of water. Moreover, the Indian Ocean lies within the
  region of typhoons; and if, at the height of an inundation, a hurricane
  from the south-east swept up the Persian Gulf, driving its shallow waters
  upon the delta and damming back the outflow, perhaps for hundreds of
  miles up-stream, a diluvial catastrophe, fairly up to the mark of
  Hasisadra's, might easily result.<a name="NtA172"
  href="#Nt172"><sup>[172]</sup></a></p>

  <p>Thus there seems to be no valid reason for rejecting Hasisadra's story
  on physical grounds. I do not gather from the narrative that the
  "mountains of Nizir" were supposed to be submerged, but merely that they
  came into view above the distant horizon of the waters, as the vessel
  drove in that direction. Certainly the ship is not supposed to ground on
  any of their higher summits, for Hasisadra has to ascend a peak in order
  to offer his sacrifice. The country of Nizir lay on the north-eastern
  side of the Euphrates <!-- Page 591 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page591"></a>{591}</span>valley, about the courses of the two
  rivers Zab, which enter the Tigris where it traverses the plain of
  Assyria some eight or nine hundred feet above the sea; and, so far as I
  can judge from maps<a name="NtA173" href="#Nt173"><sup>[173]</sup></a>
  and other sources of information, it is possible, under the circumstances
  supposed, that such a ship as Hasisadra's might drive before a southerly
  gale, over a continuously flooded country, until it grounded on some of
  the low hills between which both the lower and the upper Zab enter upon
  the Assyrian plain.</p>

  <p>The tablet which contains the story under consideration is the
  eleventh of a series of twelve. Each of these answers to a month, and to
  the corresponding sign of the Zodiac. The Assyrian year began with the
  spring equinox; consequently, the eleventh month, called "the rainy,"
  answers to our January-February, and to the sign which corresponds with
  our Aquarius. The aquatic adventure of Hasisadra, therefore, is not
  inappropriately placed. It is curious, however, that the season thus
  indirectly assigned to the flood is not that of the present highest level
  of the rivers. It is too late for the winter rise and too early for the
  spring floods.</p>

  <p>I think it must be admitted that, so far, the physical
  cross-examination to which Hasisadra has been subjected does not break
  down his story. On the contrary, he proves to have kept it in all
  essential respects<a name="NtA174" href="#Nt174"><sup>[174]</sup></a>
  within the bounds of probability or <!-- Page 592 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page592"></a>{592}</span>possibility. However,
  we have not yet done with him. For the conditions which obtained in the
  Euphrates valley, four or five thousand years ago, may have differed to
  such an extent from those which now exist that we should be able to
  convict him of having made up his tale. But here again everything is in
  favour of his credibility. Indeed, he may claim very powerful support,
  for it does not lie in the mouths of those who accept the authority of
  the Pentateuch to deny that the Euphrates valley was what it is, even six
  thousand years back. According to the book of Genesis, Phrat and
  Hiddekel&mdash;the Euphrates and the Tigris&mdash;are coeval with
  Paradise. An edition of the Scriptures, recently published under high
  authority, with an elaborate apparatus of "Helps" for the use of
  students&mdash;and therefore, as I am bound to suppose, purged of all
  statements that could by any possibility mislead the young&mdash;assigns
  the year <span class="scac">B.C.</span> 4004 as the date of Adam's too
  brief residence in that locality.</p>

  <p>But I am far from depending on this authority for the age of the
  Mesopotamian plain. On the contrary, I venture to rely, with much more
  confidence, on another kind of evidence, which tends to show that the age
  of the great rivers must be carried back to a date earlier than that at
  which our ingenuous youth is instructed that the earth came into
  existence. For, the alluvial deposit having been brought down by the
  rivers, they must needs be older than the plain it <!-- Page 593 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page593"></a>{593}</span>forms, as navvies must
  needs antecede the embankment painfully built up by the contents of their
  wheelbarrows. For thousands of years, heat and cold, rain, snow, and
  frost, the scrubbing of glaciers, and the scouring of torrents laden with
  sand and gravel, have been wearing down the rocks of the upper basins of
  the rivers, over an area of many thousand square miles; and these
  materials, ground to fine powder in the course of their long journey,
  have slowly subsided, as the water which carried them spread out and lost
  its velocity in the sea. It is because this process is still going on
  that the shore of the delta constantly encroaches on the head of the
  gulf<a name="NtA175" href="#Nt175"><sup>[175]</sup></a> into which the
  two rivers are constantly throwing the waste of Armenia and of Kurdistan.
  Hence, as might be expected, fluviatile and marine shells are common in
  the alluvial deposit; and Loftus found strata, containing subfossil
  marine shells of species now living, in the Persian Gulf, at Warka, two
  hundred miles in a straight line from the shore of the delta.<a
  name="NtA176" href="#Nt176"><sup>[176]</sup></a> It follows that, if a
  trustworthy estimate of the average rate of growth of the alluvial can be
  formed, the lowest limit (by no means the highest limit) of age of the
  rivers can be determined. All such estimates are beset <!-- Page 594
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page594"></a>{594}</span>with sources
  of error of very various kinds; and the best of them can only be regarded
  as approximations to the truth. But I think it will be quite safe to
  assume a maximum rate of growth of four miles in a century for the lower
  half of the alluvial plain.</p>

  <p>Now, the cycle of narratives of which Hasisadra's adventure forms a
  part contains allusions not only to Surippak, the exact position of which
  is doubtful, but to other cities, such as Erech. The vast ruins at the
  present village of Warka have been carefully explored and determined to
  be all that remains of that once great and flourishing city, "Erech the
  lofty." Supposing that the two hundred miles of alluvial country, which
  separates them from the head of the Persian Gulf at present, have been
  deposited at the very high rate of four miles in a century, it will
  follow that 4000 years ago, or about the year 2100 <span
  class="scac">B.C.</span>, the city of Erech still lay forty miles inland.
  Indeed, the city might have been built a thousand years earlier.
  Moreover, there is plenty of independent archæological and other evidence
  that in the whole thousand years, 2000 to 3000 <span
  class="scac">B.C.</span>, the alluvial plain was inhabited by a numerous
  people, among whom industry, art, and literature had attained a very
  considerable development. And it can be shown that the physical
  conditions and the climate of the Euphrates valley, at that time, must
  have been extremely similar to what they are now.</p>

  <p>Thus, once more, we reach the conclusion that, as a question of
  physical probability, there is no ground for objecting to the reality of
  Hasisadra's adventure. <!-- Page 595 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page595"></a>{595}</span>It would be unreasonable to doubt that
  such a flood might have happened, and that such a person might have
  escaped in the way described, any time during the last 5000 years. And if
  the postulate of loose thinkers in search of scientific "confirmations"
  of questionable narratives&mdash;proof that an event may have happened is
  evidence that it did happen&mdash;is to be accepted, surely Hasisadra's
  story is "confirmed by modern scientific investigation" beyond all cavil.
  However, it may be well to pause before adopting this conclusion, because
  the original story, of which I have set forth only the broad outlines,
  contains a great many statements which rest upon just the same foundation
  as those cited, and yet are hardly likely to meet with general
  acceptance. The account of the circumstances which led up to the flood,
  of those under which Hasisadra's adventure was made known to his
  descendant, of certain remarkable incidents before and after the flood,
  are inseparably bound up with the details already given. And I am unable
  to discover any justification for arbitrarily picking out some of these
  and dubbing them historical verities, while rejecting the rest as
  legendary fictions. They stand or fall together.</p>

  <p>Before proceeding to the consideration of these less satisfactory
  details, it is needful to remark that Hasisadra's adventure is a mere
  episode in a cycle of stories of which a personage, whose name is
  provisionally read "Izdubar," is the centre. The nature of Izdubar hovers
  vaguely between the heroic and the divine; sometimes he seems a mere man,
  sometimes <!-- Page 596 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page596"></a>{596}</span>approaches so closely to the divinities of
  fire and of the sun as to be hardly distinguishable from them. As I have
  already mentioned, the tablet which sets forth Hasisadra's perils is one
  of twelve; and, since each of these represents a month and bears a story
  appropriate to the corresponding sign of the Zodiac, great weight must be
  attached to Sir Henry Rawlinson's suggestion that the epos of Izdubar is
  a poetical embodiment of solar mythology.</p>

  <p>In the earlier books of the epos, the hero, not content with rejecting
  the proffered love of the Chaldæan Aphrodite, Istar, freely expresses his
  very low estimate of her character; and it is interesting to observe
  that, even in this early stage of human experience, men had reached a
  conception of that law of nature which expresses the inevitable
  consequences of an imperfect appreciation of feminine charms. The injured
  goddess makes Izdubar's life a burden to him, until at last, sick in body
  and sorry in mind, he is driven to seek aid and comfort from his forbears
  in the world of spirits. So this antitype of Odysseus journeys to the
  shore of the waters of death, and there takes ship with a Chaldæan
  Charon, who carries him within hail of his ancestor Hasisadra. That
  venerable personage not only gives Izdubar instructions how to regain his
  health, but tells him, somewhat <i>à propos des bottes</i> (after the
  manner of venerable personages), the long story of his perilous
  adventure; and how it befell that he, his wife, and his steersman came to
  dwell among the blessed gods, without passing through the portals of
  death like ordinary mortals. <!-- Page 597 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page597"></a>{597}</span></p>

  <p>According to the full story, the sins of mankind had become grievous;
  and, at a council of the gods, it was resolved to extirpate the whole
  race by a great flood. And, once more, let us note the uniformity of
  human experience. It would appear that, four thousand years ago, the
  obligations of confidential intercourse about matters of state were
  sometimes violated&mdash;of course from the best of motives. Ea, one of
  the three chiefs of the Chaldæan Pantheon, the god of justice and of
  practical wisdom, was also the god of the sea; and, yielding to the
  temptation to do a friend a good turn, irresistible to kindly seafaring
  folks of all ranks, he warned Hasisadra of what was coming. When Bel
  subsequently reproached him for this breach of confidence, Ea defended
  himself by declaring that he did not tell Hasisadra anything; he only
  sent him a dream. This was undoubtedly sailing very near the wind; but
  the attribution of a little benevolent obliquity of conduct to one of the
  highest of the gods is a trifle compared with the truly Homeric
  anthropomorphism which characterises other parts of the epos.</p>

  <p>The Chaldæan deities are, in truth, extremely human; and,
  occasionally, the narrator does not scruple to represent them in a manner
  which is not only inconsistent with our idea of reverence, but is
  sometimes distinctly humorous.<a name="NtA177"
  href="#Nt177"><sup>[177]</sup></a> When the storm is at its height, he
  exhibits them flying in a state of panic to Anu, the god of heaven, and
  crouching <!-- Page 598 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page598"></a>{598}</span>before his portal like frightened dogs. As
  the smoke of Hasisadra's sacrifice arises, the gods, attracted by the
  sweet savour, are compared to swarms of flies. I have already remarked
  that the lady Istar's reputation is torn to shreds; while she and Ea
  scold Bel handsomely for his ferocity and injustice in destroying the
  innocent along with the guilty. One is reminded of Here hung up with
  weighted heels; of misleading dreams sent by Zeus; of Ares howling as he
  flies from the Trojan battlefield; and of the very questionable dealings
  of Aphrodite with Helen and Paris.</p>

  <p>But to return to the story. Bel was, at first, excluded from the
  sacrifice as the author of all the mischief; which really was somewhat
  hard upon him, since the other gods agreed to his proposal. But
  eventually a reconciliation takes place; the great bow of Anu is
  displayed in the heavens; Bel agrees that he will be satisfied with what
  war, pestilence, famine, and wild beasts can do in the way of destroying
  men; and that, henceforward, he will not have recourse to extraordinary
  measures. Finally, it is Bel himself who, by way of making amends,
  transports Hasisadra, his wife, and the faithful Nes-Hea to the abode of
  the gods.</p>

  <p>It is as indubitable as it is incomprehensible to most of us, that,
  for thousands of years, a great people, quite as intelligent as we are,
  and living in as high a state of civilisation as that which had been
  attained in the greater part of Europe a few centuries ago, entertained
  not the slightest doubt that Anu, <!-- Page 599 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page599"></a>{599}</span>Bel, Ea, Istar, and the
  rest, were real personages, possessed of boundless powers for good and
  evil. The sincerity of the monarchs whose inscriptions gratefully
  attribute their victories to Merodach, or to Assur, is as little to be
  questioned as that of the authors of the hymns and penitential psalms
  which give full expression to the heights and depths of religious
  devotion. An "infidel" bold enough to deny the existence, or to doubt the
  influence, of these deities probably did not exist in all Mesopotamia;
  and even constructive rebellion against their authority was apt to end in
  the deprivation, not merely of the good name, but of the skin of the
  offender. The adherents of modern theological systems dismiss these
  objects of the love and fear of a hundred generations of their equals,
  offhand, as "gods of the heathen," mere creations of a wicked and
  idolatrous imagination; and, along with them, they disown, as senseless,
  the crude theology, with its gross anthropomorphism and its low ethical
  conception of the divinity, which satisfied the pious souls of
  Chaldæa.</p>

  <p>I imagine, though I do not presume to be sure, that any endeavour to
  save the intellectual and moral credit of Chaldæan religion, by
  suggesting the application to it of that universal solvent of
  absurdities, the allegorical method, would be scouted; I will not even
  suggest that any ingenuity can be equal to the discovery of the antitypes
  of the personifications effected by the religious imagination of later
  ages, in the triad Anu, Ea, and Bel, still less in Istar. Therefore,
  unless some plausible reconciliatory scheme <!-- Page 600 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page600"></a>{600}</span>should be propounded by
  a Neo-Chaldæan devotee (and, with Neo-Buddhists to the fore, this
  supposition is not so wild as it looks), I suppose the moderns will
  continue to smile, in a superior way, at the grievous absurdity of the
  polytheistic idolatry of these ancient people.</p>

  <p>It is probably a congenital absence of some faculty which I ought to
  possess which withholds me from adopting this summary procedure. But I am
  not ashamed to share David Hume's want of ability to discover that
  polytheism is, in itself, altogether absurd. If we are bound, or
  permitted, to judge the government of the world by human standards, it
  appears to me that directorates are proved, by <span class="correction"
  title="Original reads 'familar'.">familiar</span> experience, to conduct
  the largest and the most complicated concerns quite as well as solitary
  despots. I have never been able to see why the hypothesis of a divine
  syndicate should be found guilty of innate absurdity. Those Assyrians, in
  particular, who held Assur to be the one supreme and creative deity, to
  whom all the other supernal powers were subordinate, might fairly ask
  that the essential difference between their system and that which obtains
  among the great majority of their modern theological critics should be
  demonstrated. In my apprehension, it is not the quantity, but the
  quality, of the persons, among whom the attributes of divinity are
  distributed, which is the serious matter. If the divine might is
  associated with no higher ethical attributes than those which obtain
  among ordinary men; if the divine intelligence is supposed to be so
  imperfect <!-- Page 601 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page601"></a>{601}</span>that it cannot foresee the consequences of
  its own contrivances; if the supernal powers can become furiously angry
  with the creatures of their omnipotence and, in their senseless wrath,
  destroy the innocent along with the guilty; or if they can show
  themselves to be as easily placated by presents and gross flattery as any
  oriental or occidental despot; if, in short, they are only stronger than
  mortal men and no better, as it must be admitted Hasisadra's deities
  proved themselves to be&mdash;then, surely, it is time for us to look
  somewhat closely into their credentials, and to accept none but
  conclusive evidence of their existence.</p>

  <p>To the majority of my respected contemporaries this reasoning will
  doubtless appear feeble, if not worse. However, to my mind, such are the
  only arguments by which the Chaldæan theology can be satisfactorily
  upset. So far from there being any ground for the belief that Ea, Anu,
  and Bel are, or ever were, real entities, it seems to me quite infinitely
  more probable that they are products of the religious imagination, such
  as are to be found everywhere and in all ages, so long as that
  imagination riots uncontrolled by scientific criticism.</p>

  <p>It is on these grounds that I venture, at the risk of being called an
  atheist by the ghosts of all the principals of all the colleges of
  Babylonia, or by their living successors among the Neo-Chaldæans, if that
  sect should arise, to express my utter disbelief in the gods of
  Hasisadra. Hence, it follows, that I find Hasisadra's account of their
  share in his adventure <!-- Page 602 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page602"></a>{602}</span>incredible; and, as the physical details
  of the flood are inseparable from its theophanic accompaniments, and are
  guaranteed by the same authority, I must let them go with the rest. The
  consistency of such details with probability counts for nothing. The
  inhabitants of Chaldæa must always have been familiar with inundations;
  probably no generation failed to witness an inundation which rose
  unusually high, or was rendered serious by coincident atmospheric, or
  other, disturbances. And the memory of the general features of any
  exceptionally severe and devastating flood, would be preserved by popular
  tradition for long ages. What, then, could be more natural than that a
  Chaldæan poet should seek for the incidents of a great catastrophe among
  such phenomena? In what other way than by such an appeal to their
  experience could he so surely awaken in his audience the tragic pity and
  terror? What possible ground is there for insisting that he must have had
  some individual flood in view, and that his history is historical, in the
  sense that the account of the effects of a hurricane in the Bay of
  Bengal, in the year 1875, is historical?</p>

  <p>&nbsp;</p>

  <p>More than three centuries after the time of Assurbanipal, Berosus of
  Babylon, born in the reign of Alexander the Great, wrote an account of
  the history of his country in Greek. The work of Berosus has vanished;
  but extracts from it&mdash;how far faithful is uncertain&mdash;have been
  preserved by later writers. Among these occurs the well-known <!-- Page
  603 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page603"></a>{603}</span>story of
  the Deluge of Xisuthros, which is evidently built upon the same
  foundation as that of Hasisadra. The incidents of the divine warning, the
  building of the ship, the sending out of birds, the ascension of the
  hero, betray their common origin. But stories, like Madeira, acquire a
  heightened flavour with time and travel; and the version of Berosus is
  characterised by those circumstantial improbabilities which habitually
  gather round the legend of a legend. The later narrator knows the exact
  day of the month on which the flood began. The dimensions of the ship are
  stated with Munchausenian precision at five stadia by two&mdash;say, half
  by one-fifth of an English mile. The ship runs aground among the "Gordæan
  mountains" to the south of Lake Van, in Armenia, beyond the limits of any
  imaginable real inundation of the Euphrates valley; and, by way of
  climax, we have the assertion, worthy of the sailor who said that he had
  brought up one of Pharaoh's chariot wheels on the fluke of his anchor in
  the Red Sea, that pilgrims visited the locality and made amulets of the
  bitumen which they scraped off from the still extant remains of the
  mighty ship of Xisuthros.</p>

  <p>Suppose that some later polyhistor, as devoid of critical faculty as
  most of his tribe, had found the version of Berosus, as well as another
  much nearer the original story; that, having too much respect for his
  authorities to make up a <i>tertium quid</i> of his own, out of the
  materials offered, he followed a practice, common enough among ancient
  and, particularly, among Semitic historians, of dividing <!-- Page 604
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page604"></a>{604}</span>both into
  fragments and piecing them together, without troubling himself very much
  about the resulting repetitions and inconsistencies; the product of such
  a primitive editorial operation would be a narrative analogous to that
  which treats of the Noachian deluge in the book of Genesis. For the
  Pentateuchal story is indubitably a patchwork, composed of fragments of
  at least two, different and partly discrepant, narratives, quilted
  together in such an inartistic fashion that the seams remain conspicuous.
  And, in the matter of circumstantial exaggeration, it in some respects
  excels even the second-hand legend of Berosus.</p>

  <p>There is a certain practicality about the notion of taking refuge from
  floods and storms in a ship provided with a steersman; but, surely, no
  one who had ever seen more water than he could wade through would dream
  of facing even a moderate breeze, in a huge three-storied coffer, or box,
  three hundred cubits long, fifty wide and thirty high, left to drift
  without rudder or pilot.<a name="NtA178"
  href="#Nt178"><sup>[178]</sup></a> Not content with giving the exact year
  of Noah's age in which the flood began, the Pentateuchal story adds the
  month and the day of <!-- Page 605 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page605"></a>{605}</span>the month. It is the Deity himself who
  "shuts in" Noah. The modest week assigned to the full deluge in
  Hasisadra's story becomes forty days, in one of the Pentateuchal
  accounts, and a hundred and fifty in the other. The flood, which, in the
  version of Berosus, has grown so high as to cast the ship among the
  mountains of Armenia, is improved upon in the Hebrew account until it
  covers "all the high hills that were under the whole heaven"; and, when
  it begins to subside, the ark is left stranded on the summit of the
  highest peak, commonly identified with Ararat itself.</p>

  <p>While the details of Hasisadra's adventure are, at least, compatible
  with the physical conditions of the Euphrates valley, and, as we have
  seen, involve no catastrophe greater than such as might be brought under
  those conditions, many of the very precisely stated details of Noah's
  flood contradict some of the best established results of scientific
  inquiry.</p>

  <p>If it is certain that the alluvium of the Mesopotamian plain has been
  brought down by the Tigris and the Euphrates, then it is no less certain
  that the physical structure of the whole valley has persisted, without
  material modification, for many thousand years before the date assigned
  to the flood. If the summits, even of the moderately elevated ridges
  which immediately bound the valley, still more those of the Kurdish and
  Armenian mountains, were ever covered by water, for even forty days, that
  water must have extended over the whole earth. If the earth was thus
  covered, anywhere between 4000 and 5000 years ago, or, at any other time,
  since the <!-- Page 606 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page606"></a>{606}</span>higher terrestrial animals came into
  existence, they must have been destroyed from the whole face of it, as
  the Pentateuchal account declares they were three several times (Genesis
  vii. 21, 22, 23), in language which cannot be made more emphatic, or more
  solemn, than it is; and the present population must consist of the
  descendants of emigrants from the ark. And, if that is the case, then, as
  has often been pointed out, the sloths of the Brazilian forests, the
  kangaroos of Australia, the great tortoises of the Galapagos islands,
  must have respectively hobbled, hopped, and crawled over many thousand
  miles of land and sea from "Ararat" to their present habitations. Thus,
  the unquestionable facts of the geographical distribution of recent land
  animals, alone, form an insuperable obstacle to the acceptance of the
  assertion that the kinds of animals composing the present terrestrial
  fauna have been, at any time, universally destroyed in the way described
  in the Pentateuch.</p>

  <p>It is upon this and other unimpeachable grounds, that, as I ventured
  to say some time ago, persons who are duly conversant with even the
  elements of natural science decline to take the Noachian deluge
  seriously; and that, as I also pointed out, candid theologians, who,
  without special scientific knowledge, have appreciated the weight of
  scientific arguments, have long since given it up. But, as Goethe has
  remarked, there is nothing more terrible than energetic ignorance<a
  name="NtA179" href="#Nt179"><sup>[179]</sup></a>; and there are, even
  yet, very <!-- Page 607 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page607"></a>{607}</span>energetic people, who are neither candid,
  nor clearheaded, nor theologians, still less properly instructed in the
  elements of natural science, who make prodigious efforts to obscure the
  effect of these plain truths, and to conceal their real surrender of the
  historical character of Noah's deluge under cover of the smoke of a great
  discharge of pseudoscientific artillery. They seem to imagine that the
  proofs which abound in all parts of the world, of large oscillations of
  the relative level of land and sea, combined with the probability that,
  when the sea-level was rising, sudden incursions of the sea, like that
  which broke in over Holland and formed the Zuyder Zee, may have often
  occurred, can be made to look like evidence that something that, by
  courtesy, might be called a general Deluge has really taken place. Their
  discursive energy drags misunderstood truth into their service; and "the
  glacial epoch" is as sure to crop up among them as King Charles's head in
  a famous memorial&mdash;with about as much appropriateness. The old story
  of the raised beach on Moel Tryfaen is trotted out; though, even if the
  facts are as yet rightly interpreted, there is not a shadow of evidence
  that the change of sea-level in that locality was sudden, or that glacial
  Welshmen would have known it was taking place.<a name="NtA180"
  href="#Nt180"><sup>[180]</sup></a> Surely it is difficult to perceive the
  relevancy of bringing in something that happened in the glacial <!-- Page
  608 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page608"></a>{608}</span>epoch (if
  it did happen) to account for the tradition of a flood in the Euphrates
  valley between 2000 and 3000 <span class="scac">B.C.</span> But the date
  of the Noachian flood is solidly fixed by the sole authority for it; no
  shuffling of the chronological data will carry it so far back as 3000
  <span class="scac">B.C.</span>; and the Hebrew epos agrees with the
  Chaldæan in placing it after the development of a somewhat advanced
  civilisation. The only authority for the Noachian deluge assures us that,
  before it visited the earth, Cain had built cities; Jubal had invented
  harps and organs; while mankind had advanced so far beyond the neolithic,
  nay even the bronze, stage that Tubal-cain was a worker in iron.
  Therefore, if the Noachian legend is to be taken for the history of an
  event which happened in the glacial epoch, we must revise our notions of
  pleistocene civilisation. On the other hand, if the Pentateuchal story
  only means something quite different, that happened somewhere else,
  thousands of years earlier, dressed up, what becomes of its credit as
  history? I wonder what would be said to a modern historian who asserted
  that Pekin was burnt down in 1886, and then tried to justify the
  assertion by adducing evidence of the Great Fire of London in 1666. Yet
  the attempt to save the credit of the Noachian story by reference to
  something which is supposed to have happened in the far north, in the
  glacial epoch, is far more preposterous.</p>

  <p>Moreover, these dust-raising dialecticians ignore some of the most
  important and well-known facts <!-- Page 609 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page609"></a>{609}</span>which bear upon the question. Anything
  more than a parochial acquaintance with physical geography and geology
  would suffice to remind its possessor that the Holy Land itself offers a
  standing protest against bringing such a deluge as that of Noah anywhere
  near it, either in historical times or in the course of that pleistocene
  period, of which the "great ice age" formed a part.</p>

  <p>Judæa and Galilee, Moab and Gilead, occupy part of that extensive
  tableland at the summit of the western boundary of the Euphrates valley,
  to which I have already referred. If that valley had ever been filled
  with water to a height sufficient, not indeed to cover a third of Ararat,
  in the north, or half some of the mountains of the Persian frontier in
  the east, but to reach even four or five thousand feet, it must have
  stood over the Palestinian hog's-back, and have filled, up to the brim,
  every depression on its surface. Therefore it could not have failed to
  fill that remarkable trench in which the Dead Sea, the Jordan, and the
  Sea of Galilee lie, and which is known as the "Jordan-Arabah" valley.</p>

  <p>This long and deep hollow extends more than 200 miles, from near the
  site of ancient Dan in the north, to the water-parting at the head of the
  Wady Arabah in the south; and its deepest part, at the bottom of the
  basin of the Dead Sea, lies 2500 feet below the surface of the adjacent
  Mediterranean. The lowest portion of the rim of the Jordan-Arabah valley
  is situated at the village of El Fuleh, 257 feet above the Mediterranean.
  Everywhere else the <!-- Page 610 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page610"></a>{610}</span>circumjacent heights rise to a very much
  greater altitude. Hence, of the water which stood over the Syrian
  tableland, when as much drained off as could run away, enough would
  remain to form a "Mere" without an outlet, 2757 feet deep, over the
  present site of the Dead Sea. From this time forth, the level of the
  Palestinian mere could be lowered only by evaporation. It is an extremely
  interesting fact, which has happily escaped capture for the purposes of
  the energetic misunderstanding, that the valley, at one time, was filled,
  certainly within 150 feet of this height&mdash;probably higher. And it is
  almost equally certain, that the time at which this great Jordan-Arabah
  mere reached its highest level coincides with the glacial epoch. But then
  the evidence which goes to prove this, also leads to the conclusion that
  this state of things obtained at a period considerably older than even
  4004 <span class="scac">B.C.</span>, when the world, according to the
  "Helps" (or shall we say "Hindrances") provided for the simple student of
  the Bible, was created; that it was not brought about by any diluvial
  catastrophe, but was the result of a change in the relative activities of
  certain natural operations which are quietly going on now; and that,
  since the level of the mere began to sink, many thousand years ago, no
  serious catastrophe of any description has affected the valley.</p>

  <p>The evidence that the Jordan-Arabah valley really was once filled with
  water, the surface of which reached within 160 feet of the level of the
  pass of Jezrael, and possibly stood higher, is this: Remains <!-- Page
  611 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page611"></a>{611}</span>of
  alluvial strata, containing shells of the freshwater mollusks which still
  inhabit the valley, worn down into terraces by waves which long rippled
  at the same level, and furrowed by the channels excavated by modern
  rainfalls, have been found at the former height; and they are repeated,
  at intervals, lower down, until the Ghor, or plain of the Jordan, itself
  an alluvial deposit, is reached. These strata attain a considerable
  thickness; and they indicate that the epoch at which the freshwater mere
  of Palestine reached its highest level is extremely remote; that its
  diminution has taken place very slowly, and with periods of rest, during
  which the first formed deposits were cut down into terraces. This
  conclusion is strikingly borne out by other facts. A volcanic region
  stretches from Galilee to Gilead and the Hauran, on each side of the
  northern end of the valley. Some of the streams of basaltic lava which
  have been thrown out from its craters and clefts in times of which
  history has no record, have run athwart the course of the Jordan itself,
  or of that of some of its tributary streams. The lava streams, therefore,
  must be of later date than the depressions they fill. And yet, where they
  have thus temporarily dammed the Jordan and the Jermuk, these streams
  have had time to cut through the hard basalts and lay bare the beds, over
  which, before the lava streams invaded them, they flowed.</p>

  <p>In fact, the antiquity of the present Jordan-Arabah valley, as a
  hollow in a tableland, out of reach of the sea, and troubled by no
  diluvial or other <!-- Page 612 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page612"></a>{612}</span>disturbances, beyond the volcanic
  eruptions of Gilead and of Galilee, is vast, even as estimated by a
  geological standard. No marine deposits of later than miocene age occur
  in or about it; and there is every reason to believe that the
  Syro-Arabian plateau has been dry land, throughout the pliocene and later
  epochs, down to the present time. Raised beaches, containing recent
  shells, on the Levantine shores of the Mediterranean and on those of the
  Red Sea, testify to a geologically recent change of the sea level to the
  extent of 250 or 300 feet, probably produced by the slow elevation of the
  land; and, as I have already remarked, the alluvial plain of the
  Euphrates and Tigris appears to have been affected in the same way though
  seemingly to a less extent. But of violent, or catastrophic, change there
  is no trace. Even the volcanic outbursts have flowed in even sheets over
  the old land surface; and the long lines of the horizontal terraces which
  remain, testify to the geological insignificance of such earthquakes as
  have taken place. It is, indeed, possible that the original formation of
  the valley may have been determined by the well-known fault, along which
  the western rocks are relatively depressed and the eastern elevated. But,
  whether that fault was effected slowly or quickly, and whenever it came
  into existence, the excavation of the valley to its present width, no
  less than the sculpturing of its steep walls and of the innumerable deep
  ravines which score them down to the very bottom, are indubitably due to
  the operation of rain and streams, during an enormous length of time,
  <!-- Page 613 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page613"></a>{613}</span>without interruption or disturbance of any
  magnitude. The alluvial deposits which have been mentioned are continued
  into the lateral ravines, and have more or less filled them. But, since
  the waters have been lowered, these deposits have been cut down to great
  depths, and are still being excavated by the present temporary, or
  permanent, streams. Hence, it follows, that all these ravines must have
  existed before the time at which the valley was occupied by the great
  mere. This fact acquires a peculiar importance when we proceed to
  consider the grounds for the conclusion that the old Palestinian mere
  attained its highest level in the cold period of the pleistocene epoch.
  It is well known that glaciers formerly came low down on the flanks of
  Lebanon and Antilebanon; indeed, the old moraines are the haunts of the
  few survivors of the famous cedars. This implies a perennial snowcap of
  great extent on Hermon; therefore, a vastly greater supply of water to
  the sources of the Jordan which rise on its flanks; and, in addition,
  such a total change in the general climate, that the innumerable Wadys,
  now traversed only by occasional storm torrents, must have been occupied
  by perennial streams. All this involves a lower annual temperature and a
  moist and rainy atmosphere. If such a change of meteorological conditions
  could be effected now, when the loss by evaporation from the surface of
  the Dead Sea salt-pan balances all the gain from the Jordan and other
  streams, the scale would be turned in the other direction. The waters of
  the Dead Sea would become diluted; its level would rise; <!-- Page 614
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page614"></a>{614}</span>it would
  cover, first the plain of the Jordan, then the lake of Galilee, then the
  middle Jordan between this lake and that of Huleh (the ancient Merom);
  and, finally, it would encroach, northwards, along the course of the
  upper Jordan, and, southwards, up the Wady Arabah, until it reached some
  260 feet above the level of the Mediterranean, when it would attain a
  permanent level, by sending any superfluity through the pass of Jezrael
  to swell the waters of the Kishon, and flow thence into the
  Mediterranean.</p>

  <p>Reverse the process, in consequence of the excess of loss by
  evaporation over gain by inflow, which must have set in as the climate of
  Syria changed after the end of the pleistocene epoch, and (without taking
  into consideration any other circumstances) the present state of things
  must eventually be reached&mdash;a concentrated saline solution in the
  deepest part of the valley&mdash;water, rather more charged with saline
  matter than ordinary fresh water, in the lower Jordan and the lake of
  Galilee&mdash;fresh waters, still largely derived from the snows of
  Hermon, in the upper Jordan and in Lake Huleh. But, if the full state of
  Jordan valley marks the glacial epoch, then it follows that the
  excavation of that valley by atmospheric agencies must have occupied an
  immense antecedent time&mdash;a large part, perhaps the whole, of the
  pliocene epoch; and we are thus forced to the conclusion that, since the
  miocene epoch, the physical conformation of the Holy Land has been
  substantially what it is now. It has been more or less rained upon,
  searched by <!-- Page 615 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page615"></a>{615}</span>earthquakes here and there, partially
  overflowed by lava streams, slowly raised (relatively to the sea-level) a
  few hundred feet. But there is not a shadow of ground for supposing that,
  throughout all this time, terrestrial animals have ceased to inhabit a
  large part of its surface; or that, in many parts, they have been, in any
  respect, incommoded by the changes which have taken place.</p>

  <p>The evidence of the general stability of the physical conditions of
  Western Asia, which is furnished by Palestine and by the Euphrates
  Valley, is only fortified if we extend our view northwards to the Black
  Sea and the Caspian. The Caspian is a sort of magnified replica of the
  Dead Sea. The bottom of the deepest part of this vast inland mere is 3000
  feet below the level of the Mediterranean, while its surface is lower by
  85 feet. At present, it is separated, on the west, by wide spaces of dry
  land from the Black Sea, which has the same height as the Mediterranean,
  and, on the east, from the Aral, 138 feet above that level. The waters of
  the Black Sea, now in communication with the Mediterranean by the
  Dardanelles and the Bosphorus, are salt, but become brackish northwards,
  where the rivers of the steppes pour in a great volume of fresh water.
  Those of the shallower northern half of the Caspian are similarly
  affected by the Volga and the Ural, while, in the shallow bays of the
  southern division, they become extremely saline in consequence of the
  intense evaporation. The Aral Sea, though supplied by the Jaxartes and
  the Oxus, has brackish water. There is evidence <!-- Page 616 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page616"></a>{616}</span>that, in the pliocene
  and pleistocene periods, to go no farther back, the strait of the
  Dardanelles did not exist, and that the vast area, from the valley of the
  Danube to that of the Jaxartes, was covered by brackish or, in some
  parts, fresh water to a height of at least 200 feet above the level of
  the Mediterranean. At the present time, the water-parting which separates
  the northern part of the basin of the Caspian from the vast plains
  traversed by the Tobol and the Obi, in their course to the Arctic Ocean,
  appears to be less than 200 feet above the latter. It would seem,
  therefore, to be very probable that, under the climatal conditions of
  part of the pleistocene period, the valley of the Obi played the same
  part in relation to the Ponto-Aralian sea, as that of the Kishon may have
  done to the great mere of the Jordan valley; and that the outflow formed
  the channel by which the well-known Arctic elements of the fauna of the
  Caspian entered it. For the fossil remains imbedded in the strata
  continuously deposited in the Aralo-Caspian area, since the latter end of
  the miocene epoch, show no sign that, from that time onward, it has ever
  been covered by sea water. Therefore, the supposition of a free inflow of
  the Arctic Ocean, which at one time was generally received, as well as
  that of various hypothetical deluges from that quarter, must be seriously
  questioned.</p>

  <p>The Caspian and the Aral stand in somewhat the same relation to the
  vast basin of dry land in which they lie, as the Dead Sea and the lake of
  Galilee to the Jordan valley. They are the remains of a vast, <!-- Page
  617 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page617"></a>{617}</span>mostly
  brackish, mere, which has dried up in consequence of the excess of
  evaporation over supply, since the cold and damp climate of the
  pleistocene epoch gave place to the increasing dryness and great summer
  heats of Central Asia in more modern times. The desiccation of the
  Aralo-Caspian basin, which communicated with the Black Sea only by a
  comparatively narrow and shallow strait along the present valley of
  Manytsch, the bottom of which was less than 100 feet above the
  Mediterranean, must have been vastly aided by the erosion of the strait
  of the Dardanelles towards the end of the pleistocene epoch, or perhaps
  later. For the result of thus opening a passage for the waters of the
  Black Sea into the Mediterranean must have been the gradual lowering of
  its level to that of the latter sea. When this process had gone so far as
  to bring down the Black Sea water to within less than a hundred feet of
  its present level, the strait of Manytsch ceased to exist; and the vast
  body of fresh water brought down by the Danube, the Dnieper, the Don, and
  other South Russian rivers was cut off from the Caspian, and eventually
  delivered into the Mediterranean. Thus, there is as conclusive evidence
  as one can well hope to obtain in these matters, that, north of the
  Euphrates valley, the physical geography of an area as large as all
  Central Europe has remained essentially unchanged, from the miocene
  period down to our time; just as, to the west of the Euphrates valley,
  Palestine has exhibited a similar persistence of geographical type. To
  the south, the valley of the Nile <!-- Page 618 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page618"></a>{618}</span>tells exactly the same
  story. The holes bored by miocene mollusks in the cliffs east and west of
  Cairo bear witness that, in the miocene epoch, it contained an arm of the
  sea, the bottom of which has since been gradually filled up by the
  alluvium of the Nile, and elevated to its present position. But the
  higher parts of the Mokattam and of the desert about Ghizeh, have been
  dry land from that time to this. Too little is known of the geology of
  Persia, at present, to allow any positive conclusion to be enunciated.
  But, taking the name to indicate the whole continental mass of Iran,
  between the valleys of the Indus and the Euphrates, the supposition that
  its physical geography has remained unchanged for an immensely long
  period is hardly rash. The country is, in fact, an enormous basin,
  surrounded on all sides by a mountainous rim, and subdivided within by
  ridges into plateaus and hollows, the bottom of the deepest of which, in
  the province of Seistan, probably descends to the level of the Indian
  Ocean. These depressions are occupied by salt marshes and deserts, in
  which the waters of the streams which flow down the sides of the basin
  are now dissipated by evaporation. I am acquainted with no evidence that
  the present Iranian basin was ever occupied by the sea; but the
  accumulations of gravel over a great extent of its surface indicate
  long-continued water action. It is, therefore, a fair presumption that
  large lakes have covered much of its present deserts, and that they have
  dried up by the operation of the same changed climatal conditions as
  those which have <!-- Page 619 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page619"></a>{619}</span>reduced the Caspian and the Dead Sea to
  their present dimensions.<a name="NtA181"
  href="#Nt181"><sup>[181]</sup></a></p>

  <p>Thus it would seem that the Euphrates valley, the centre of the fabled
  Noachian deluge, is also the centre of a region covering some millions of
  square miles of the present continents of Europe, Asia, and Africa, in
  which all the facts, relevant to the argument, at present known, converge
  to the conclusion that, since the miocene epoch, the essential features
  of its physical geography have remained unchanged; that it has neither
  been depressed below the sea, nor swept by diluvial waters since that
  time; and that the Chaldean version of the legend of a flood in the
  Euphrates valley is, of all those which are extant, the only one which is
  even consistent with probability, since it depicts a local inundation not
  more severe than one which might be brought about by a concurrence of
  favourable conditions at the present day, and which might probably have
  been more easily effected when the Persian Gulf extended farther north.
  Hence, the recourse to the "glacial epoch" for some event which might
  colourably represent a flood, distinctly asserted by the only authority
  for it to have occurred in historical times, is peculiarly unfortunate.
  Even a Welsh antiquarian might hesitate over the supposition that a
  tradition of the fate of Moel Tryfaen, in the glacial epoch, had
  furnished the basis of fact for a legend <!-- Page 620 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page620"></a>{620}</span>which arose among
  people whose own experience abundantly supplied them with the needful
  precedents. Moreover, if evidence of interchanges of land and sea are to
  be accepted as "confirmations" of Noah's deluge, there are plenty of
  sources for the tradition to be had much nearer than Wales.</p>

  <p>The depression now filled by the Red Sea, for example, appears to be,
  geologically, of very recent origin. The later deposits found on its
  shores, two or three hundred feet above the sea level, contain no remains
  older than those of the present fauna; while, as I have already
  mentioned, the valley of the adjacent delta of the Nile was a gulf of the
  sea in miocene times. But there is not a particle of evidence that the
  change of relative level which admitted the waters of the Indian Ocean
  between Arabia and Africa, took place any faster than that which is now
  going on in Greenland and Scandinavia, and which has left their
  inhabitants undisturbed. Even more remarkable changes were effected,
  towards the end of, or since, the glacial epoch, over the region now
  occupied by the Levantine Mediterranean and the Ægean Sea. The eastern
  coast region of Asia Minor, the western of Greece, and many of the
  intermediate islands, exhibit thick masses of stratified deposits of
  later tertiary age and of purely lacustrine characters; and it is
  remarkable that, on the south side of the island of Crete, such masses
  present steep cliffs facing the sea, so that the southern boundary of the
  lake in which they were formed must have been situated where the sea now
  flows. Indeed, there are <!-- Page 621 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page621"></a>{621}</span>valid reasons for the supposition that the
  dry land once extended far to the west of the present Levantine coast,
  and not improbably forced the Nile to seek an outlet to the north-east of
  its present delta&mdash;a possibility of no small importance in relation
  to certain puzzling facts in the geographical distribution of animals in
  this region. At any rate, continuous land joined Asia Minor with the
  Balkan peninsula; and its surface bore deep freshwater lakes, apparently
  disconnected with the Ponto-Aralian sea. This state of things lasted long
  enough to allow of the formation of the thick lacustrine strata to which
  I have referred. I am not aware that there is the smallest ground for the
  assumption that the Ægean land was broken up in consequence of any of the
  "catastrophes" which are so commonly invoked.<a name="NtA182"
  href="#Nt182"><sup>[182]</sup></a> For anything that appears to the
  contrary, the narrow, steep-sided, straits between the islands of the
  Ægean archipelago may have been originally brought about by ordinary
  atmospheric and stream action; and then filled from the Mediterranean,
  during a slow submergence proceeding from the south northwards. The
  strait of the Dardanelles is bounded by undisturbed pleistocene strata
  forty feet thick, through which, to all appearance, the present passage
  has been quietly cut.</p>

  <p>That Olympus and Ossa were torn asunder and the waters of the
  Thessalian basin poured forth, is a very ancient notion, and an often
  cited "confirmation" of Deucalion's flood. It has not yet ceased to <!--
  Page 622 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page622"></a>{622}</span>be in
  vogue, apparently because those who entertain it are not aware that
  modern geological investigation has conclusively proved that the gorge of
  the Peneus is as typical an example of a valley of erosion as any to be
  seen in Auvergne or in Colorado.<a name="NtA183"
  href="#Nt183"><sup>[183]</sup></a></p>

  <p>Thus, in the immediate vicinity of the vast expanse of country which
  can be proved to have been untouched by any catastrophe before, during,
  and since the "glacial epoch," lie the great areas of the Ægean and the
  Red Sea, in which, during or since the glacial epoch, changes of the
  relative positions of land and sea have taken place, in comparison with
  which the submergence of Moel Tryfaen, with all Wales and Scotland to
  boot, does not come to much.</p>

  <p>What, then, is the relevancy of talk about the "glacial epoch" to the
  question of the historical veracity of the narrator of the story of the
  Noachian deluge? So far as my knowledge goes, there is not a particle of
  evidence that destructive inundations were more common over the general
  surface of the earth in the glacial epoch than they have been before or
  since. No doubt the fringe of an ice-covered region must be always liable
  to them; but, if we examine the records of such catastrophes in
  historical times, those produced in the deltas of great rivers, or in
  lowlands like Holland, by sudden floods, combined with gales of wind or
  with unusual tides, far excel all others.</p>

  <p>With respect to such inundations as are the <!-- Page 623 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page623"></a>{623}</span>consequences of
  earthquakes, and other slight movements of the crust of the earth, I have
  never heard of anything to show that they were more frequent and severer
  in the quaternary or tertiary epochs than they are now. In the discussion
  of these, as of all other geological problems, the appeal to needless
  catastrophes is born of that impatience of the slow and painful search
  after sufficient causes in the ordinary course of nature which is a
  temptation to all, though only energetic ignorance nowadays completely
  succumbs to it.</p>

<p class="cenhead"><span class="sc">Postscript.</span></p>

  <p>My best thanks are due to Mr. Gladstone for his courteous withdrawal
  of one of the statements to which I have thought it needful to take
  exception. The familiarity with controversy, to which Mr. Gladstone
  alludes, will have accustomed him to the misadventures which arise when,
  as sometimes will happen in the heat of fence, the buttons come off the
  foils. I trust that any scratch which he may have received will heal as
  quickly as my own flesh wounds have done.</p>

  <p>&nbsp;</p>

  <p>A contribution to the last number of this Review of a different order
  would be left unnoticed, were it not that my silence would convert me
  into an accessory to misrepresentations of a very grave character.
  However, I shall restrict myself to the barest possible statement of
  facts, leaving my readers to draw their own conclusions.</p>

  <p>In an article entitled "A Great Lesson," published in this Review for
  September 1887:</p>

  <p>(1) The Duke of Argyll says the "overthrow of Darwin's speculations"
  (p. 301) concerning the origin of coral reefs, which he fancied had taken
  place, had been received by men of science "with a grudging silence as
  far as public discussion is concerned" (p. 301).</p>

<p><!-- Page 624 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page624"></a>{624}</span></p>

  <p>The truth is that, as every one acquainted with the literature of the
  subject was well aware, the views supposed to have effected this
  overthrow had been fully and publicly discussed by Dana in the United
  States; by Geikie, Green, and Prestwich in this country; by Lapparent in
  France; and by Credner in Germany.</p>

  <p>(2) The Duke of Argyll says "that no serious reply has ever been
  attempted" (p. 305).</p>

  <p>The truth is that the highest living authority on the subject,
  Professor Dana, published a most weighty reply, two years before the Duke
  of Argyll committed himself to this statement.</p>

  <p>(3) The Duke of Argyll uses the preceding products of defective
  knowledge, multiplied by excessive imagination, to illustrate the manner
  in which "certain accepted opinions" established "a sort of Reign of
  Terror in their own behalf" (p. 307).</p>

  <p>The truth is that no plea, except that of total ignorance of the
  literature of the subject, can excuse the errors cited, and that the
  "Reign of Terror" is a purely subjective phenomenon.</p>

  <p>(4) The letter in <i>Nature</i> for the 17th of November 1887, to
  which I am referred, contains neither substantiation, nor retractation,
  of statements 1 and 2. Nevertheless, it repeats number 3. The Duke of
  Argyll says of his article that it "has done what I intended it to do. It
  has called wide attention to the influence of mere authority in
  establishing erroneous theories and in retarding the progress of
  scientific truth."</p>

  <p>(5) The Duke of Argyll illustrates the influence of his fictitious
  "Reign of Terror" by the statement that Mr. John Murray "was strongly
  advised against the publication of his views in derogation of Darwin's
  long-accepted theory of the coral islands, and was actually induced to
  delay it for two years" (p. 307). And in <i>Nature</i> for the 17th
  November 1887, the Duke of Argyll states that he has seen a letter from
  Sir Wyville Thomson in which he "urged and almost insisted that Mr.
  Murray should withdraw the reading of his papers on the subject from the
  Royal Society of Edinburgh. This was in February 1877." The next
  paragraph, however, contains the confession: "No special reason was
  assigned." The Duke of Argyll proceeds to give a speculative opinion that
  "Sir Wyville <!-- Page 625 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page625"></a>{625}</span>dreaded some injury to the scientific
  reputation of the body of which he was the chief." Truly, a very probable
  supposition; but as Sir Wyville Thomson's tendencies were notoriously
  anti-Darwinian, it does not appear to me to lend the slightest
  justification to the Duke of Argyll's insinuation that the Darwinian
  "terror" influenced him. However, the question was finally set at rest by
  a letter which appeared in <i>Nature</i> (29th of December 1887), in
  which the writer says that:</p>

</blockquote>

<blockquote class="b2n">

  <p>talking with Sir Wyville about "Murray's new theory," I asked what
  objection he had to its being brought before the public? The answer
  simply was: he considered that the grounds of the theory had not, as yet,
  been sufficiently investigated or sufficiently corroborated, and that
  therefore any immature, dogmatic publication of it would do less than
  little service either to science or to the author of the paper.</p>

</blockquote>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>Sir Wyville Thomson was an intimate friend of mine, and I am glad to
  have been afforded one more opportunity of clearing his character from
  the aspersions which have been so recklessly cast upon his good sense and
  his scientific honour.</p>

  <p>(6) As to the "overthrow" of Darwin's theory, which, according to the
  Duke of Argyll, was patent to every unprejudiced person four years ago, I
  have recently become acquainted with a work, in which a really competent
  authority,<a name="NtA184" href="#Nt184"><sup>[184]</sup></a> thoroughly
  acquainted with all the new lights which have been thrown upon the
  subject during the last ten years, pronounces the judgment; firstly, that
  some of the facts brought forward by Messrs. Murray and Guppy against
  Darwin's theory are not facts; secondly, that the others are reconcilable
  with Darwin's theory; and, thirdly, that the theories of Messrs. Murray
  and Guppy "are contradicted by a series of important facts" (p. 13).</p>

  <p>Perhaps I had better draw attention to the circumstance that Dr.
  Langenbeck writes under shelter of the guns of the fortress of
  Strassburg; and may therefore be presumed to be unaffected by those
  dreams of a "Reign of Terror" which seem to disturb the peace of some of
  us in these islands (April 1891).</p>

  <p><a name="Nt13" href="#NtA13">[13]</a> It may be objected that I have
  not put the case fairly, inasmuch as the solitary insect's wing which was
  discovered twelve months ago in Silurian rocks, and which is, at present,
  the sole evidence of insects older than the Devonian epoch, came from
  strata of Middle Silurian age, and is therefore older than the scorpions
  which, within the last two years, have been found in Upper Silurian
  strata in Sweden, Britain, and the United States. But no one who
  comprehends the nature of the evidence afforded by fossil remains would
  venture to say that the non-discovery of scorpions in the Middle Silurian
  strata, up to this time, affords any more ground for supposing that they
  did not exist, than the non-discovery of flying insects in the Upper
  Silurian strata, up to this time, throws any doubt on the certainty that
  they existed, which is derived from the occurrence of the wing in the
  Middle Silurian. In fact, I have stretched a point in admitting that
  these fossils afford a colourable pretext for the assumption that the
  land and air-population were of contemporaneous origin.</p>

  which I should have been glad to quote in my text if I had known them
  sooner:&mdash;</p>

  <p>"Nor can it be ever more than a speculation; it cannot be established
  by observation, nor can it be proved by calculation. It is merely a
  conjecture, more or less plausible, but perhaps, in some degree,
  necessarily true, if our present laws of heat, as we understand them,
  admit of the extreme application here required, and if the present order
  of things has reigned for sufficient time without the intervention of any
  influence at present known to us" (<i>The Story of the Heavens</i>, p.
  506).</p>

  <p>Would any prudent advocate base a plea, either for or against
  revelation, upon the coincidence, or want of coincidence, of the
  declarations of the latter with the requirements of an hypothesis thus
  guardedly dealt with by an astronomical expert?</p>

  <p><a name="Nt26" href="#NtA26">[26]</a> Even the most sturdy believers
  in the popular theory that the proper or titular names attached to the
  books of the Bible are those of their authors will hardly be prepared to
  maintain that Jephthah, Gideon, and their colleagues wrote the book of
  Judges. Nor is it easily admissible that Samuel wrote the two books which
  pass under his name, one of which deals entirely with events which took
  place after his death. In fact, no one knows who wrote either Judges or
  Samuel, nor when, within the range of 100 years, their present form was
  given to these books.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt27" href="#NtA27">[27]</a> My citations are taken from the
  Revised Version, but for <span class="sc">Lord</span> and <span
  class="sc">God</span> I have substituted Jahveh and Elohim.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt28" href="#NtA28">[28]</a> I need hardly say that I depend
  upon authoritative Biblical critics, whenever a question of
  interpretation of the text arises. As Reuss appears to me to be one of
  the most learned, acute, and fair-minded of those whose works I have
  studied, I have made most use of the commentary and dissertations in his
  splendid French edition of the Bible. But I have also had recourse to the
  works of Dillman, Kalisch, Kuenen, Thenius, Tuch, and others, in cases in
  which another opinion seemed desirable.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt29" href="#NtA29">[29]</a> See "Divination," by Hazoral,
  <i>Journal of Anthropology</i>, Bombay, vol. i. No. 1.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt30" href="#NtA30">[30]</a> See, for example, the message of
  Jephthah to the King of the Ammonites: "So now Jahveh, the Elohim of
  Israel, hath dispossessed the Amorites from before his people Israel, and
  shouldest thou possess them? Wilt not thou possess that which Chemosh,
  thy Elohim, giveth thee to possess?" (Jud. xi. 23, 24). For Jephthah,
  Chemosh is obviously as real a personage as Jahveh.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt31" href="#NtA31">[31]</a> For example: "My oblation, my
  food for my offerings made by fire, of a sweet savour to me, shall ye
  observe to offer unto me in their due season" (Num. xxviii. 2).</p>

  <p><a name="Nt32" href="#NtA32">[32]</a> In 2 Samuel xv. 27 David says to
  Zadok the priest, "Art thou not a seer?" and Gad is called David's
  seer.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt33" href="#NtA33">[33]</a> This would at first appear to be
  inconsistent with the use of the word "prophetess" for Deborah. But it
  does not follow because the writer of Judges applies the name to Deborah
  that it was used in her day.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt34" href="#NtA34">[34]</a> Samuel tells the cook, "Bring
  the portion which I gave thee, of which I said to thee, Set it by thee."
  It was therefore Samuel's to give. "And the cook took up the thigh (or
  shoulder) and that which was upon it and set it before Saul." But, in the
  Levitical regulations, it is the thigh (or shoulder) which becomes the
  priest's own property. "And the right thigh (or shoulder) shall ye give
  unto the priest for an heave-offering," which is given along with the
  wave breast "unto Aaron the priest and unto his sons as a due for ever
  from the children of Israel" (Lev. vii. 31-34). Reuss writes on this
  passage: "La cuisse n'est point agitée, mais simplement <i>prelevée</i>
  sur ce que les convives mangeront."</p>

  <p><a name="Nt35" href="#NtA35">[35]</a> See, for example, Elkanah's
  sacrifice, 1 Sam. i. 3-9.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt36" href="#NtA36">[36]</a> The ghost was not supposed to be
  capable of devouring the gross material substance of the offering; but
  his vaporous body appropriated the smoke of the burnt sacrifice, the
  visible and odorous exhalations of other offerings. The blood of the
  victim was particularly useful because it was thought to be the special
  seat of its soul or life. A West African negro replied to an European
  sceptic: "Of course, the spirit cannot eat corporeal food, but he
  extracts its spiritual part, and, as we see, leaves the material part
  behind" (Lippert, <i>Seelencult</i>, p. 16).</p>

  <p><a name="Nt37" href="#NtA37">[37]</a> It is further well worth
  consideration whether indications of former ancestor-worship are not to
  be found in the singular weight attached to the veneration of parents in
  the fourth commandment. It is the only positive commandment, in addition
  to those respecting the Deity and that concerning the Sabbath, and the
  penalties for infringing it were of the same character. In China, a
  corresponding reverence for parents is part and parcel of
  ancestor-worship; so in ancient Rome and in Greece (where parents were
  even called <span title="deuteroi kai epigeoi theoi" class="grk"
  >&delta;&epsilon;&#x1F7B;&tau;&epsilon;&rho;&omicron;&iota;
  &kappa;&alpha;&#x1F76;
  &#x1F10;&pi;&#x1F77;&gamma;&epsilon;&omicron;&iota;
  &theta;&epsilon;&omicron;&#x1F77;</span>). The fifth commandment, as it
  stands, would be an excellent compromise between ancestor-worship and
  monotheism. The larger hereditary share allotted by Israelitic law to the
  eldest son reminds one of the privileges attached to primogeniture in
  ancient Rome, which were closely connected with ancestor-worship. There
  is a good deal to be said in favour of the speculation that the ark of
  the covenant may have been a relic of ancestor-worship; but that topic is
  too large to be dealt with incidentally in this place.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt59" href="#NtA59">[59]</a> I am not unaware of the

  orthodox Judaism is now pretty much what it was in Philo's time; while
  Peter and Paul, if they could return to life, would certainly have to
  learn the catechism of either the Roman, Greek, or Anglican Churches, if
  they desired to be considered orthodox Christians.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt61" href="#NtA61">[61]</a> See the famous <i>Collection of
  Papers</i>, published by Clarke in 1717. Leibnitz says: "'Tis also a
  supernatural thing that bodies should <i>attract</i> one another at a
  distance without any intermediate means." And Clarke, on behalf of
  Newton, caps this as follows: "That one body should attract another
  without any intermediate <i>means</i> is, indeed, not a <i>miracle</i>,
  but a contradiction; for 'tis supposing something to act where it is
  not."</p>

  <p><a name="Nt62" href="#NtA62">[62]</a> I may cite in support of this
  obvious conclusion of sound reasoning, two authorities who will certainly
  not be regarded lightly by Mr. Lilly. These are Augustine and Thomas
  Aquinas. The former declares that "Fate" is only an ill-chosen name for
  Providence.</p>

  <p>"Prorsus divina providentia regna constituuntur humana. Quæ si
  propterea quisquam fato tribuit, quia ipsam Dei voluntatem vel potestatem
  fati nomine appellat, <i>sententiam teneat, linguam corrigat</i>"
  (Augustinus <i>De Civitate Dei</i>, V. c. i.)</p>

  <p>The other great doctor of the Catholic Church, "Divus Thomas," as
  Suarez calls him, whose marvellous grasp and subtlety of intellect seem
  to me to be almost without a parallel, puts the whole case into a
  nutshell, when he says that the ground for doing a thing in the mind of
  the doer is as it were the pre-existence of the thing done:</p>

  <p>"Ratio autem alicujus fiendi in mente actoris existens est quædam
  præ-existentia rei fiendæ in eo" (<i>Summa</i>, Qu. xxiii. Art. i.)</p>

  <p>If this is not enough, I may further ask what "Materialist" has ever
  given a better statement of the case for determinism, on theistic
  grounds, than is to be found in the following passage of the
  <i>Summa</i>, Qu. xiv. Art. xiii.</p>

  <p>"Omnia quæ sunt in tempore, sunt Deo ab æterno præsentia, non solum ea
  ex ratione quâ habet rationes rerum apud se presentes, ut quidam dicunt,
  sed quia ejus intuitus fertur ab æterno supra omnia, prout sunt in sua
  præsentialitate. <i>Unde manifestum est quod contingentia infallibiliter
  a Deo cognoscuntur</i>, in quantum subduntur divino conspectui secundum
  suam præsentialitatem; et tamen sunt futura contingentia, suis causis
  proximis comparata."</p>

  <p>[As I have not said that Thomas Aquinas is professedly a determinist,
  I do not see the bearing of citations from him which may be more or less
  inconsistent with the foregoing.]</p>

  <p><a name="Nt63" href="#NtA63">[63]</a> There is no exaggeration in this
  brief and summary view of the Catholic cosmos. But it would be unfair to
  leave it to be supposed that the Reformation made any essential
  alteration, except perhaps for the worse, in that cosmology which called
  itself "Christian." The protagonist of the Reformation, from whom the
  whole of the Evangelical sects are lineally descended, states the case
  with that plainness of speech, not to say brutality, which characterised
  him. Luther says that man is a beast of burden who only moves as his
  rider orders; sometimes God rides him, and sometimes Satan. "Sic voluntas
  humana in medio posita est, ceu jumentum; si insederit Deus, vult et
  vadit, quo vult Deus.... Si insederit Satan, vult et vadit, quo vult
  Satan; nec est in ejus arbitrio ad utrum sessorem currere, aut eum
  quærere, sed ipsi sessores certant ob ipsum obtinendum et possidendum"
  (<i>De Servo Arbitrio</i>, M. Lutheri Opera, ed. 1546, t. ii. p. 468).
  One may hear substantially the same doctrine preached in the parks and at
  street-corners by zealous volunteer missionaries of Evangelicism, any
  Sunday, in modern London. Why these doctrines, which are conspicuous by
  their absence in the four Gospels, should arrogate to themselves the
  title of Evangelical, in contradistinction to Catholic, Christianity, may
  well perplex the impartial inquirer, who, if he were obliged to choose
  between the two, might naturally prefer that which leaves the poor beast
  of burden a little freedom of choice.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt64" href="#NtA64">[64]</a> I say "so-called" not by way of
  offence, but as a protest against the monstrous assumption that Catholic
  Christianity is explicitly or implicitly contained in any trustworthy
  record of the teaching of Jesus of Nazareth.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt65" href="#NtA65">[65]</a> It may be desirable to observe
  that, in modern times, the term "Realism" has acquired a signification
  wholly different from that which attached to it in the middle ages. We
  commonly use it as the contrary of Idealism. The Idealist holds that the
  phenomenal world has only a subjective existence, the Realist that it has
  an objective existence. I am not aware that any mediæval philosopher was
  an Idealist in the sense in which we apply the term to Berkeley. In fact,
  the cardinal defect of their speculations lies in their oversight of the
  considerations which lead to Idealism. If many of them regarded the
  material world as a negation, it was an active negation; not zero, but a
  minus quantity.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt66" href="#NtA66">[66]</a> At any rate a catastrophe
  greater than the flood, which, as I observe with interest, is as calmly
  assumed by the preacher to be an historical event as if science had never
  had a word to say on that subject!</p>

  <p><a name="Nt69" href="#NtA69">[69]</a> The Duke of Argyll speaks of the
  recent date of the demonstration of the fallacy of the doctrine in
  question. "Recent" is a relative term, but I may mention that the
  question is fully discussed in my book on "Hume"; which, if I may believe
  my publishers, has been read by a good many people since it appeared in
  1879. Moreover, I observe, from a note at page 89 of <i>The Reign of
  Law</i>, a work to which I shall have occasion to advert by and by, that
  the Duke of Argyll draws attention to the circumstance that, so long ago
  as 1866, the views which I hold on this subject were well known. The
  Duke, in fact, writing about this time, says, after quoting a phrase of
  mine: "The question of miracles seems now to be admitted on all hands to
  be simply a question of evidence." In science we think that a teacher who
  ignores views which have been discussed <i>coram populo</i> for twenty
  years, is hardly up to the mark.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt70" href="#NtA70">[70]</a> See also vol. i. p. 460. In the
  ninth edition (1853), published twenty-three years after the first, Lyell
  deprives even the most careless reader of any excuse for misunderstanding
  him: "So in regard to subterranean movements, the theory of the perpetual
  uniformity of the force which they exert on the earth-crust is quite
  consistent with the admission of their alternate development and
  suspension for indefinite periods within limited geographical areas" (p.
  187).</p>

  <p><a name="Nt71" href="#NtA71">[71]</a> A great many years ago
  (Presidential Address to the Geological Society, 1869) I ventured to
  indicate that which seemed to me to be the weak point, not in the
  fundamental principles of uniformitarianism, but in uniformitarianism as
  taught by Lyell. It lay, to my mind, in the refusal by Hutton, and in a
  less degree by Lyell, to look beyond the limits of the time recorded by
  the stratified rocks. I said: "This attempt to limit, at a particular
  point, the progress of inductive and deductive reasoning from the things
  which are to the things which were&mdash;this faithlessness to its own
  logic, seems to me to have cost uniformitarianism the place as the
  permanent form of geological speculation which it might otherwise have
  held" (<i>Lay Sermons</i>, p. 260). The context shows that
  "uniformitarianism" here means that doctrine, as limited in application
  by Hutton and Lyell, and that what I mean by "evolutionism" is consistent
  and thoroughgoing uniformitarianism.</p>

  teaching on these subjects." And he seems to think the question
  appropriately answered by the assertion that it "ought to be regarded as
  settled by M. Renan's practical surrender of the adverse case." I thought
  I knew M. Renan's works pretty well, but I have contrived to miss this
  "practical" (I wish Dr. Wace had defined the scope of that useful
  adjective) surrender. However, as Dr. Wace can find no difficulty in
  pointing out the passage of M. Renan's writings, by which he feels
  justified in making his statement, I shall wait for further
  enlightenment, contenting myself, for the present, with remarking that if
  M. Renan were to retract and do penance in Notre-Dame to-morrow for any
  contributions to Biblical criticism that may be specially his property,
  the main results of that criticism, as they are set forth in the works of
  Strauss, Baur, Reuss, and Volkmar, for example, would not be sensibly
  affected.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt83" href="#NtA83">[83]</a> [See De Gobineau, <i>Les
  Religions et les Philosophies dans l'Asie Centrale</i>; and the recently
  published work of Mr. E.&nbsp;G. Browne, <i>The Episode of the Bab</i>.]</p>

  <p><a name="Nt84" href="#NtA84">[84]</a> Here, as always, the revised
  version is cited.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt85" href="#NtA85">[85]</a> Does any one really mean to say
  that there is any internal or external criterion by which the reader of a
  biblical statement, in which scientific matter is contained, is enabled
  to judge whether it is to be taken <i>au sérieux</i> or not? Is the
  account of the Deluge, accepted as true in the New Testament, less
  precise and specific than that of the call of Abraham, also accepted as
  true therein? By what mark does the story of the feeding with manna in
  the wilderness, which involves some very curious scientific problems,
  show that it is meant merely for edification, while the story of the
  inscription of the Law on stone by the hand of Jahveh is literally true?
  If the story of the Fall is not the true record of an historical
  occurrence, what becomes of Pauline theology? Yet the story of the Fall
  as directly conflicts with probability, and is as devoid of trustworthy
  evidence, as that of the Creation or that of the Deluge, with which it
  forms an harmoniously legendary series.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt86" href="#NtA86">[86]</a> See, for an admirable discussion
  of the whole subject, Dr. Abbott's article on the Gospels in the
  <i>Encyclopædia Britannica</i>; and the remarkable monograph by Professor
  Volkmar, <i>Jesus Nazarenus und die erste christliche Zeit</i> (1882).
  Whether we agree with the conclusions of these writers or not, the method
  of critical investigation which they adopt is unimpeachable.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt87" href="#NtA87">[87]</a> Notwithstanding the hard words
  shot at me from behind the hedge of anonymity by a writer in a recent
  number of the <i>Quarterly Review</i>, I repeat, without the slightest
  fear of refutation, that the four Gospels, as they have come to us, are
  the work of unknown writers.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt88" href="#NtA88">[88]</a> Their arguments, in the long
  run, are always reducible to one form. Otherwise trustworthy witnesses
  affirm that such and such events took place. These events are
  inexplicable, except the agency of "spirits" is admitted. Therefore
  "spirits" were the cause of the phenomena.</p>

  <p>And the heads of the reply are always the same. Remember Goethe's
  aphorism: "Alles factische ist schon Theorie." Trustworthy witnesses are
  constantly deceived, or deceive themselves, in their interpretation of
  sensible phenomena. No one can prove that the sensible phenomena, in
  these cases, could be caused only by the agency of spirits: and there is
  abundant ground for believing that they may be produced in other ways.
  Therefore, the utmost that can be reasonably asked for, on the evidence
  as it stands, is suspension of judgment. And, on the necessity for even
  that suspension, reasonable men may differ, according to their views of
  probability.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt89" href="#NtA89">[89]</a> Yet I must somehow have laid
  hold of the pith of the matter, for, many years afterwards, when Dean
  Mansell's Bampton lectures were published, it seemed to me I already knew
  all that this eminently agnostic thinker had to tell me.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt100" href="#NtA100">[100]</a> It is pretty clear that
  Eginhard had his doubts about the deacon, whose pledges he qualifies as
  <i>sponsiones incertæ</i>. But, to be sure, he wrote after events which
  fully justified scepticism.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt101" href="#NtA101">[101]</a> The words are <i>scrinia sine

  forbid the idea of breaking open.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt102" href="#NtA102">[102]</a> Eginhard speaks with lofty
  contempt of the "vana ac superstitiosa præsumptio" of the poor woman's
  companions in trying to alleviate her sufferings with "herbs and
  frivolous incantations." Vain enough, no doubt, but the "mulierculæ"
  might have returned the epithet "superstitious" with interest.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt103" href="#NtA103">[103]</a> Of course there is nothing
  new in this argument; but it does not grow weaker by age. And the case of
  Eginhard is far more instructive than that of Augustine, because the

  his own mental and moral habits, but those of the people about him.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt106" href="#NtA106">[106]</a> I may perhaps return to the
  question of the authorship of the Gospels. For the present I must content
  myself with warning my readers against any reliance upon Dr. Wace's
  statements as to the results arrived at by modern criticism. They are as
  gravely as surprisingly erroneous.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt107" href="#NtA107">[107]</a> The United States ought,
  perhaps, to be added, but I am not sure.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt108" href="#NtA108">[108]</a> Imagine that all our chairs
  of Astronomy had been founded in the fourteenth century, and that their
  incumbents were bound to sign Ptolemaic articles. In that case, with
  every respect for the efforts of persons thus hampered to attain and
  expound the truth, I think men of common sense would go elsewhere to
  learn astronomy. Zeller's <i>Vorträge und Abhandlungen</i> were published
  and came into my hands a quarter of a century ago. The writer's rank, as
  a theologian to begin with, and subsequently as a historian of Greek
  philosophy, is of the highest. Among these essays are two&mdash;<i>Das
  Urchristenthum</i> and <i>Die Tübinger historische Schule</i>&mdash;which
  are likely to be of more use to those who wish to know the real state of
  the case than all that the official "apologists," with their one eye on
  truth and the other on the tenets of their sect, have written. For the
  opinion of a scientific theologian about theologians of this stamp see
  pp. 225 and 227 of the <i>Vorträge</i>.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt109" href="#NtA109">[109]</a> I suppose this is what Dr.
  Wace is thinking about when he says that I allege that there "is no
  visible escape" from the supposition of an <i>Ur-Marcus</i> (p. 367).
  That a "theologian of repute" should confound an indisputable fact with
  one of the modes of explaining that fact is not so singular as those who
  are unaccustomed to the ways of theologians might imagine.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt110" href="#NtA110">[110]</a> Any examiner whose duty it
  has been to examine into a case of "copying" will be particularly well
  prepared to appreciate the force of the case stated in that most
  excellent little book, <i>The Common Tradition of the Synoptic
  Gospels</i>, by Dr. Abbott and Mr. Rushbrooke (Macmillan, 1884). To those
  who have not passed through such painful experiences I may recommend the
  brief discussion of the genuineness of the "Casket Letters" in my friend
  Mr. Skelton's interesting book, <i>Maitland of Lethington</i>. The second
  edition of Holtzmann's <i>Lehrbuch</i>, published in 1886, gives a
  remarkably fair and full account of the present results of criticism. At
  p. 366 he writes that the present burning question is whether the
  "relatively primitive narrative and the root of the other synoptic texts
  is contained in Matthew or in Mark. It is only on this point that
  properly-informed (<i>sachkundige</i>) critics differ," and he decides in
  favour of Mark.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt111" href="#NtA111">[111]</a> Holtzmann (<i>Die
  synoptischen Evangelien</i>, 1863, p. 75), following Ewald, argues that
  the "Source A" ( = the threefold tradition, more or less) contained
  something that answered to the "Sermon on the Plain" immediately after
  the words of our present Mark, "And he cometh into a house" (iii. 19).
  But what conceivable motive could "Mark" have for omitting it? Holtzmann
  has no doubt, however, that the "Sermon on the Mount" is a compilation,
  or, as he calls it in his recently-published <i>Lehrbuch</i> (p. 372),
  "an artificial mosaic work."</p>

  <p><a name="Nt112" href="#NtA112">[112]</a> See Schürer, <i>Geschichte

  <p><a name="Nt113" href="#NtA113">[113]</a> Spacious, because a young man
  could sit in it "on the right side" (xv. 5), and therefore with plenty of
  room to spare.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt114" href="#NtA114">[114]</a> King Herod had not the least
  difficulty in supposing the resurrection of John the Baptist&mdash;"John,
  whom I beheaded, he is risen" (Mark vi. 16).</p>

  <p><a name="Nt115" href="#NtA115">[115]</a> I am very sorry for the
  interpolated "in," because citation ought to be accurate in small things
  as in great. But what difference it makes whether one "believes Jesus" or
  "believes in Jesus" much thought has not enabled me to discover. If you
  "believe him" you must believe him to be what he professed to
  be&mdash;that is, "believe in him;" and if you "believe in him" you must
  necessarily "believe him."</p>

  <p><a name="Nt116" href="#NtA116">[116]</a> True for Justin: but there is
  a school of theological critics, who more or less question the historical
  reality of Paul and the genuineness of even the four cardinal
  epistles.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt117" href="#NtA117">[117]</a> See <i>Dial. cum
  Tryphone</i>, § 47 and § 35. It is to be understood that Justin does not
  arrange these categories in order, as I have done.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt118" href="#NtA118">[118]</a> I guard myself against being
  supposed to affirm that even the four cardinal epistles of Paul may not
  have been seriously tampered with. See note <a href="#Nt116">116</a>, p.
  429 above.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt119" href="#NtA119">[119]</a> [Paul, in fact, is required
  to commit in Jerusalem, an act of the same character as that which he
  brands as "dissimulation" on the part of Peter in Antioch.]</p>

  <p><a name="Nt120" href="#NtA120">[120]</a> All this was quite clearly
  pointed out by Ritschl nearly forty years ago. See <i>Die Entstehung der

  <p><a name="Nt126" href="#NtA126">[126]</a> It is by no means to be
  assumed that "spiritual" and "corporeal" are exact equivalents of
  "immaterial" and "material" in the minds of ancient speculators on these
  topics. The "spiritual body" of the risen dead (1 Cor. xv.) is not the
  "natural" "flesh and blood" body. Paul does not teach the resurrection of
  the body in the ordinary sense of the word "body"; a fact, often
  overlooked, but pregnant with many consequences.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt127" href="#NtA127">[127]</a> Tertullian (<i>Apolog. adv.
  Gentes</i>, cap. xxiii.) thus challenges the Roman authorities: let them
  bring a possessed person into the presence of a Christian before their
  tribunal; and, if the demon does not confess himself to be such, on the
  order of the Christian, let the Christian be executed out of hand.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt128" href="#NtA128">[128]</a> See the expression of
  orthodox opinion upon the "accommodation" subterfuge already cited above,
  p. <a href="#page336">336</a>.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt129" href="#NtA129">[129]</a> I quote the first edition
  (1843). A second edition appeared in 1870. Tract 85 of the <i>Tracts for
  the Times</i> should be read with this <i>Essay</i>. If I were called
  upon to compile a Primer of "Infidelity," I think I should save myself
  trouble by making a selection from these works, and from the <i>Essay on
  Development</i> by the same author.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt130" href="#NtA130">[130]</a> Yet, when it suits his
  purpose, as in the Introduction to the <i>Essay on Development</i>, Dr.
  Newman can demand strict evidence in religious questions as sharply as
  any "infidel author"; and he can even profess to yield to its force
  (<i>Essay on Miracles</i>, 1870, note, p. 391).</p>

  <p><a name="Nt131" href="#NtA131">[131]</a> Compare Tract 85, p. 110: "I
  am persuaded that were men but consistent who oppose the Church doctrines
  as being unscriptural, they would vindicate the Jews for rejecting the
  Gospel."</p>

  <p><a name="Nt132" href="#NtA132">[132]</a> According to Dr. Newman,
  "This prayer [that of Bishop Alexander, who begged God to 'take Arius
  away'] is said to have been offered about 3 <span
  class="scac">P.M.</span> on the Saturday; that same evening Arius was in
  the great square of Constantine, when he was suddenly seized with
  indisposition" (p. clxx). The "infidel" Gibbon seems to have dared to
  suggest that "an option between poison and miracle" is presented by this
  case; and, it must be admitted, that, if the Bishop had been within the
  reach of a modern police magistrate, things might have gone hardly with
  him. Modern "Infidels," possessed of a slight knowledge of chemistry, are
  not unlikely, with no less audacity, to suggest an "option between
  fire-damp and miracle" in seeking for the cause of the fiery outburst at
  Jerusalem.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt133" href="#NtA133">[133]</a> A writer in a spiritualist
  journal takes me roundly to task for venturing to doubt the historical
  and literal truth of the Gadarene story. The following passage in his
  letter is worth quotation: "Now to the materialistic and scientific mind,
  to the uninitiated in spiritual verities, certainly this story of the
  Gadarene or Gergesene swine presents insurmountable difficulties; it
  seems grotesque and nonsensical. To the experienced, trained, and
  cultivated Spiritualist this miracle is, as I am prepared to show, one of
  the most instructive, the most profoundly useful, and the most beneficent
  which Jesus ever wrought in the whole course of His pilgrimage of
  redemption on earth." Just so. And the first page of this same journal
  presents the following advertisement, among others of the same
  kidney:&mdash;</p>

  <p>"<span class="sc">To Wealthy Spiritualists.</span>&mdash;A Lady Medium

  willing to give her a comfortable home and maintenance in Exchange for
  her Spiritualistic services, as her guides consider her health is too

  <p>Are we going back to the days of the Judges, when wealthy Micah set up

  <p><a name="Nt134" href="#NtA134">[134]</a> Consider Tertullian's
  "sister" ("hodie apud nos"), who conversed with angels, saw and heard
  mysteries, knew men's thoughts, and prescribed medicine for their bodies
  (<i>De Anima</i>, cap. 9). Tertullian tells us that this woman saw the
  soul as corporeal, and described its colour and shape. The "infidel" will
  probably be unable to refrain from insulting the memory of the ecstatic
  saint by the remark, that Tertullian's known views about the corporeality
  of the soul may have had something to do with the remarkable perceptive
  powers of the Montanist medium, in whose revelations of the spiritual
  world he took such profound interest.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt136" href="#NtA136">[136]</a> Dr. Newman's observation that
  the miraculous multiplication of the pieces of the true cross (with which
  "the whole world is filled," according to Cyril of Jerusalem; and of
  which some say there are enough extant to build a man-of-war) is no more
  wonderful than that of the loaves and fishes is one that I do not see my

  <p><a name="Nt138" href="#NtA138">[138]</a> Dr. Newman faces this
  question with his customary ability. "Now, I own, I am not at all
  solicitous to deny that this doctrine of an apostate Angel and his hosts
  was gained from Babylon: it might still be Divine nevertheless. God who
  made the prophet's ass speak, and thereby instructed the prophet, might
  instruct His Church by means of heathen Babylon" (Tract 85, p. 83). There
  seems to be no end to the apologetic burden that Balaam's ass can
  carry.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt161" href="#NtA161">[161]</a> Neither is it of any
  consequence whether the locality of the supposed miracle was Gadara, or
  Gerasa, or Gergesa. But I may say that I was well acquainted with
  Origen's opinion respecting Gergesa. It is fully discussed and rejected
  in Riehm's <i>Handwörterbuch</i>. In Kitto's <i>Biblical Cyclopædia</i>
  (ii. p. 51) Professor Porter remarks that Origen merely
  "<i>conjectures</i>" that Gergesa was indicated; and he adds, "Now, in a
  question of this kind, conjectures cannot be admitted. We must implicitly
  follow the most ancient and creditable testimony, which clearly
  pronounces in favour of <span title="Gadarênôn" class="grk"
  >&Gamma;&alpha;&delta;&alpha;&rho;&eta;&nu;&#x1FF6;&nu;</span>. This
  reading is adopted by Tischendorf, Alford, and Tregelles."</p>

  <p><a name="Nt162" href="#NtA162">[162]</a> I may call attention, in
  passing, to the fact that this authority, at any rate, has no sort of
  doubt of the fact that Jewish Law did not rule in Gadara (indeed, under
  the head of "Gadara," in the same work, it is expressly stated that the
  population of the place consisted "predominantly of heathens"), and that
  he scouts the notion that the Gadarene swineherds were Jews.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt163" href="#NtA163">[163]</a> The evidence adduced, so far
  as post-exile times are concerned, appears to me insufficient to prove
  this assertion.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt164" href="#NtA164">[164]</a> Even Leviticus xi. 26, cited
  without reference to the context, will not serve the purpose; because the
  swine <i>is</i> "cloven footed" (Lev. xi. 7).</p>

  <p><a name="Nt165" href="#NtA165">[165]</a> 1st Gospel: "And the devils
  <i>besought him</i>, saying, If Thou cast us out send us away <i>into</i>
  the herd of swine." 2d Gospel: "They <i>besought him</i>, saying, Send us
  <i>into</i> the swine." 3d Gospel: "They <i>intreated him</i> that he
  would give them leave to enter <i>into</i> them."</p>

  Miraculous." <i>Nineteenth Century</i>, March 1889.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt169" href="#NtA169">[169]</a> I cannot ask the Editor of
  this Review to reprint pages of an old article,&mdash;but the following
  passages sufficiently illustrate the extent and the character of the
  discrepancy between the facts of the case and Mr. Gladstone's account of
  them:&mdash;</p>

  <p>"Now, in the Gadarene affair, I do not think I am unreasonably
  sceptical if I say that the existence of demons who can be transferred
  from a man to a pig does thus contravene probability. Let me be perfectly
  candid. I admit I have no <i>à priori</i> objection to offer.... I
  declare, as plainly as I can, that I am unable to show cause why these
  transferable devils should not exist."... ("Agnosticism," <i>Nineteenth
  Century</i>, 1889, p. 177).</p>

  <p>"What then do we know about the originator, or originators, of this
  groundwork&mdash;of that threefold tradition which all three witnesses
  (in Paley's phrase) agree upon&mdash;that we should allow their mere
  statements to outweigh the counter arguments of humanity, of common
  sense, of exact science, and to imperil the respect which all would be
  glad to be able to render to their Master?" (<i>ibid.</i> p. 175).</p>

  <p>I then go on through a couple of pages to discuss the value of the
  evidence of the synoptics on critical and historical grounds. Mr.
  Gladstone cites the essay from which these passages are taken, whence I
  suppose he has read it; though it may be that he shares the impatience of
  Cardinal Manning where my writings are concerned. Such impatience will
  account for, though it will not excuse, his sixth proposition.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt170" href="#NtA170">[170]</a> The wicked, before being
  annihilated, returned to the world to disturb men; they entered into the
  body of unclean animals, "often that of a pig, as on the Sarcophagus of
  Seti I. in the Soane Museum."&mdash;Lenormant, <i>Chaldean Magic</i>, p.
  88, Editorial Note.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt171" href="#NtA171">[171]</a> In May 1849 the Tigris at
  Bagdad rose 22½ feet&mdash;5 feet above its usual rise&mdash;and nearly
  swept away the town. In 1831 a similarly exceptional flood did immense
  damage, destroying 7000 houses. See Loftus, <i>Chaldea and Susiana</i>,
  p. 7.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt172" href="#NtA172">[172]</a> See the instructive chapter
  on Hasisadra's flood in Suess, <i>Das Antlitz der Erde</i>, Abth. I. Only
  fifteen years ago a cyclone in the Bay of Bengal gave rise to a flood
  which covered 3000 square miles of the delta of the Ganges, 3 to 45 feet
  deep, destroying 100,000 people, innumerable cattle, houses, and trees.
  It broke inland, on the rising ground of Tipperah, and may have swept a
  vessel from the sea that far, though I do not know that it did.</p>

  <i>Petermanns Mittheilungen</i>, Ergänzungshefte 44 and 45, 1875-76.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt174" href="#NtA174">[174]</a> I have not cited the
  dimensions given to the ship in most translations of the story, because
  there appears to be a doubt about them. Haupt (<i>Keilinschriftliche
  Sindfluth-Bericht</i>, p. 13) says that the figures are illegible.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt175" href="#NtA175">[175]</a> It is probable that a slow
  movement of elevation of the land at one time contributed to the
  result&mdash;perhaps does so still.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt176" href="#NtA176">[176]</a> At a comparatively recent
  period, the littoral margin of the Persian Gulf extended certainly 250
  miles farther to the north-west than the present embouchure of the
  Shatt-el Arab. (Loftus, <i>Quarterly Journal of the Geological
  Society</i>, 1853, p. 251.) The actual extent of the marine deposit
  inland cannot be defined, as it is covered by later fluviatile
  deposits.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt177" href="#NtA177">[177]</a> Tiele
  (<i>Babylonisch-Assyrische Geschichte</i>, pp. 572-3) has some very just
  remarks on this aspect of the epos.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt178" href="#NtA178">[178]</a> In the second volume of the
  <i>History of the Euphrates Expedition</i>, p. 637, Col. Chesney gives a
  very interesting account of the simple and rapid manner in which the
  people about Tekrit and in the marshes of Lemlum construct large barges,
  and make them watertight with bitumen. Doubtless the practice is
  extremely ancient; and as Colonel Chesney suggests, may possibly have
  furnished the conception of Noah's ark. But it is one thing to build a
  barge 44 ft. long by 11 ft. wide and 4 ft. deep in the way described; and
  another to get a vessel of ten times the dimensions, so constructed, to
  hold together.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt180" href="#NtA180">[180]</a> The well-known difficulties
  connected with this case have recently been carefully discussed by Mr.
  Bell in the <i>Transactions</i> of the Geological Society of Glasgow.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt181" href="#NtA181">[181]</a> An instructive parallel is
  exhibited by the "Great Basin" of North America. See the remarkable
  memoir on "Lake Bonneville" by Mr. G.&nbsp;K. Gilbert, of the United States
  Geological Survey, just published.</p>
